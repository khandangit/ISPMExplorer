Adoption
This standard was first adopted by the Twenty-Eighth Session of the FAO Conference in November
1995. This first revision was adopted by the Eighteenth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary
Measures in April 2024 as the present standard.

INTRODUCTION

Scope
This standard describes the requirements for initiating, establishing and maintaining pest free areas
(PFAs) as a phytosanitary measure to support the phytosanitary certification of plants, plant products
and other regulated articles exported from the PFA or, if technically justified, as a phytosanitary measure
required by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of an importing country for the protection
of an endangered area in its territory.
This standard does not cover pest free places of production or pest free production sites, the requirements
for which can be found in ISPM 10 (Requirements for the establishment of pest free places of production
and pest free production sites).

References
The present standard refers to ISPMs. ISPMs are available on the International Phytosanitary Portal
(IPP) at www.ippc.int/core-activities/standards-setting/ispms.

Definitions
Definitions of phytosanitary terms used in this standard can be found in ISPM 5 (Glossary of
phytosanitary terms).

Outline of requirements
A PFA is a phytosanitary measure that may be used to facilitate safe trade and protect plant resources.
National plant protection organizations should consider a PFA to be a phytosanitary measure that, when
used alone, is sufficient for managing the risk associated with a specified pest.
When initiating, establishing or maintaining a PFA, NPPOs should follow the requirements outlined in
this standard. Requirements include programmes to establish and maintain a PFA, verification that PFA
status has been attained or maintained, appropriate corrective actions for pest detections, proper
documentation of these activities and appropriate record-keeping, and transparency and stakeholder
communication.
In this standard, “pest” is used to refer to a “pest or group of pests”, except where the text explicitly
refers to one pest species or to a group of pests. Where an area being established or maintained as a PFA
covers all or parts of several countries, references in this standard to the NPPO that establishes or
maintains the PFA, or to the NPPO of the country in which the PFA is situated, apply to the NPPOs of
all the countries in which the PFA is situated.

BACKGROUND
A PFA is recognized as a pest risk management option that contracting parties may consider
implementing as a phytosanitary measure to protect the plant resources of an area for agricultural,
forestry or ecological conservation purposes, facilitate safe trade, or increase the market-access
opportunities for exporting countries. Pest free areas can offer a cost-effective way for NPPOs and
industry in both importing and exporting countries to manage pest risk.



ISPM 4-4                                                         International Plant Protection Convention
 Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas                                               ISPM 4



According to Article IV.2(e) of the IPPC, the responsibility for the designation, maintenance and
surveillance of PFAs lies with NPPOs. The operational principles outlined in ISPM 1 (Phytosanitary
principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary measures in international
trade) also require contracting parties to take into account the status of an area (e.g. PFA or area with a
pest status of “absent” for the targeted pest) when determining phytosanitary measures for imports from
that area.
A PFA may be applied to an entire country or a part or parts of it. A PFA may also cover areas in several
adjacent countries. Within a single country, more than one PFA may be established for the same pest,
depending on the geography of the country, the distribution of the pest and its hosts, and the biology of
the pest.
When a PFA is established, it is usually for one pest species, but a PFA may also be established for a
defined group of pests with similar biology.

IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
This standard may contribute to the protection of biodiversity and the environment by preventing the
introduction of regulated pests into an area. When establishing and maintaining PFAs, countries are
encouraged to consider phytosanitary procedures that minimize impact on the environment.

REQUIREMENTS
A PFA should be considered a phytosanitary measure that, when used alone, is sufficient for managing
the pest risk associated with a specified pest. Where a PFA has been established and maintained in
accordance with the requirements of this standard, additional phytosanitary measures in relation to the
pest should not be imposed.
The requirements that should be met for a PFA to be established and maintained, and used as a
phytosanitary measure for trade, are detailed below. Depending on the pest concerned, an individual or
a combination of measures may be used to meet these requirements.
Requirements for the establishment and maintenance of a PFA by an NPPO include:
-     programmes to establish a PFA;
-     programmes to maintain PFA status;
-     verification that a PFA has been attained and its status is maintained;
-     corrective actions for detections of the specified pest;
-     documentation of these activities and appropriate record-keeping; and
-     transparency and communication with other NPPOs and stakeholders.
The following elements should be considered when establishing and maintaining a PFA:
-     the necessity to base measures on the biology of the pest, the relevant pathways and the
      characteristics of the area;
-     the availability of appropriate surveillance tools, technology and trained personnel to detect and
      identify the pest;
-     the existence of an appropriate regulatory framework to support the establishment and
      maintenance of the PFA;
-     the support from relevant stakeholders, such as domestic industries and local regulatory bodies;
      and
-     the importance of communicating with and raising awareness among other NPPOs, stakeholders
      and the general public.




International Plant Protection Convention                                                         ISPM 4-5
 ISPM 4                                                    Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas



In addition, NPPOs may wish to consider the feasibility of establishing and maintaining the PFA in
terms of resource availability (economic, human and technical) and the cost benefit.

1.    Initiation of a pest free area
1.1   Pest to be controlled
When initiating the establishment of a PFA, an NPPO should first specify the pest that is to be controlled
(including its scientific name) and identify valid detection and diagnostic methods and relevant aspects
of its biology.

1.2   Identification of the area
The area being considered for a PFA may be a part or parts of a country, the entire country, or all or part
of several countries. Pest free areas are generally delimited by readily recognizable boundaries,
considered to coincide acceptably with a pest’s biological limits. These may be administrative
(e.g. country, province, commune or property boundaries) or they may be natural barriers such as bodies
of water, mountains, deserts or other geographical features that prevent pest movement from one area
to another.
The area should be described specifically enough to allow it to be readily identified. This is important
when the NPPO is providing evidence to support the claim that the area is free of the pest, but also when
the NPPO is subsequently reporting the status of the targeted pest in the PFA and when raising public
awareness.

1.3   Suitability of environmental conditions in the area
The NPPO of the country in which the area is situated should determine the availability of host plants
in the area. Potential differences in host susceptibility in the area, the climatic suitability of the area, and
the potential for entry and establishment of the pest in the area should also be considered.

2.    Establishment of the pest free area
2.1   Determination of pest status in the area
Once the pest has been specified and the area identified, the NPPO should determine the pest status in
the area by conducting surveillance in accordance with the requirements outlined in ISPM 8
(Determination of pest status in an area) and ISPM 6 (Surveillance).
If an exporting country has declared a pest to be absent in an area in accordance with ISPM 8, then
establishing a PFA in that area should not be required, unless there is technical justification by importing
countries.

2.2   Controls on the movement of regulated articles
To prevent the entry of the pest into the area, the pest should be regulated in relation to the area, the
potential pathways should be identified and appropriate controls on the movement of regulated articles
should be established. The movement controls should depend on the assessed pest risk, including the
probability of pest establishment. Such controls should include:
-     regulation of the pathways and articles that require control;
-     imposition of domestic restrictions, phytosanitary import requirements, or other measures to
      control the movement of regulated articles into or through the area; and
-     inspection and testing of regulated articles where technically justified, examination of the relevant
      documentation and, where necessary for cases of non-compliance, the application of appropriate
      measures.

 Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas                                               ISPM 4



2.3   Establishment of buffer zones
Where the geographical isolation of the area is not adequate to prevent the natural spread of the pest into
it, the establishment of a buffer zone should be considered. The population of the pest in the buffer zone
should be maintained at or below a specified level, which should be verified by surveillance. The extent
of the buffer zone should be determined by the NPPO, based on the distance over which the likely
natural spread of the pest population to the area could not occur during the season when hosts are
available. The NPPO should describe, with the use of supporting maps, the boundaries of the buffer
zone.

2.4   Official declaration of pest free area
When the pest status is determined as absent (in accordance with ISPM 8) or eradication of the pest from
the area is achieved (in accordance with ISPM 9 (Guidelines for pest eradication programmes)), the
NPPO should make an official declaration that the area is free from the pest. All internal management
procedures and measures to maintain the PFA (see section 3) should be in place before any declaration
is made.

3.    Maintenance of the pest free area
The NPPO of the country in which the PFA is situated should set up a programme to ensure maintenance
of the PFA. This programme should be risk-based and should incorporate at least the following elements:
a regulatory framework to control the movement of regulated articles; surveillance and collection of
relevant data to inform the management of the PFA, including outbreak management; a framework for
reporting pest detections; and a corrective action plan in case of an outbreak, with associated provisions
for suspension and reinstatement of the PFA status.

3.1   Regulatory framework
The regulation of the pest through the controls on the movement of regulated articles (see section 2.2)
should be sufficient to prevent its entry into the PFA. Where appropriate, buffer zones should be
established to ensure early detection of the spread of the pest into the vicinity of the PFA. The measures
should also allow traceability of regulated articles introduced into the PFA or moving within the PFA
so that the appropriate corrective actions can be taken in a timely manner.

3.2   Surveillance for the maintenance of the pest free area
Surveillance should be conducted on a regular basis to verify that the absence of the pest from the PFA
is maintained.
The decision about whether general surveillance for the pest is sufficient or specific surveillance is
needed should be based on the risk of the pest’s entry and establishment in the PFA and depends on the
biology of the pest, the relevant pathways and the characteristics of the PFA.
General surveillance may be sufficient in cases where the pest has never been introduced into the PFA,
nor into the surrounding areas, and there have been no records of the pest’s presence in the PFA.
Specific surveillance to detect possible outbreaks of the pest at an early stage should be the standard
procedure in all other cases. The type and frequency of the detection surveys should be based on an
assessment of the potential for pest entry and establishment in the PFA and should allow detection of
the pest with an appropriate level of confidence.

3.3   Notification of detection of the pest
A reporting framework should be established to ensure that detections of the pest in the PFA are
immediately notified to the NPPO (or other competent authority delegated by the NPPO) and officially
confirmed. In the event of immediate or potential danger of pest spread, such as when an outbreak occurs
or a non-compliant commodity is intercepted, the relevant NPPOs should follow the guidance in


International Plant Protection Convention                                                         ISPM 4-7
 ISPM 4                                                  Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas



ISPM 13 (Guidelines for the notification of non-compliance and emergency action) and ISPM 17 (Pest
reporting) and relevant bilateral arrangements.

3.4   Response to an outbreak
Preparedness for rapid intervention may be ensured by developing, in advance, a contingency plan to
support the development and implementation of a corrective action plan in the event of an outbreak. The
contingency plan may detail the triggers for corrective actions, plans for rapid technical assessment of
the situation, the availability of financial and human resources, the roles and responsibilities of the
parties concerned, and the operational activities that are likely to be needed. To assist in preparedness,
regular simulation exercises may be used to review the effectiveness of the contingency plan.
In the event of the pest being detected in the PFA, the NPPO should determine, based on survey results,
the corrective actions to be taken. An eradication programme should be initiated for an outbreak of a
pest, but not for an interception when the consignment containing the pest can be immediately destroyed,
or where evidence indicates that there is no risk of the pest establishing or causing economic damage.
An eradication programme should follow ISPM 9 and include the following steps.

3.4.1 Delimiting survey to demarcate the outbreak area
As soon as the detection of the pest outbreak has been officially confirmed in the PFA, a delimiting
survey should be conducted to determine the boundary of the infested area. Based on this determination
and an assessment of the pest biology, the relevant pathways and the characteristics of the PFA, an
outbreak area within the PFA should be demarcated and the PFA status should be temporarily suspended
therein. This demarcated outbreak area should consist of the infested area surrounded by a buffer zone,
the size of which should depend on the biology of the pest, the availability of host plants and the
ecological conditions.

3.4.2 Implementation of control measures
Control measures should be applied to prevent the pest moving out of the outbreak area by human
activities (e.g. through the movement of infested host plants or plant products, or contaminated means
of conveyance) or, to the extent that is reasonably achievable, by natural spread.
Measures to eradicate the pest should be implemented in accordance with ISPM 9.

3.4.3 Increased surveillance in the outbreak area
Surveys should be used in the outbreak area to determine and record the distribution of the pest and its
population dynamics, and to assess the effectiveness of the eradication measures. This level of survey
should be maintained until the pest is eradicated from the outbreak area.

3.5   Provisions for suspension, reinstatement or withdrawal of the pest free area status
Criteria for successful eradication in accordance with ISPM 9 should be established in advance of the
need to eradicate an outbreak. These criteria should include the intensity of the survey in the outbreak
area and the minimum period that the outbreak area needs to be free from the pest before lifting the
suspension of the PFA.
If the criteria are fulfilled, then eradication may be officially declared successful and the temporary
control and eradication measures may be lifted. The status of the full PFA may then be reinstated.
If the criteria for eradication within the outbreak area cannot be fulfilled within a reasonable time frame
(as determined by the relevant NPPO in advance), then either the PFA status should be withdrawn or
the delimitation of the PFA should be reviewed.

4.    Regular review and verification of implementation
Once the PFA is established, including the administrative activities, the performance of the PFA
maintenance programme should be regularly reviewed by the NPPO to verify correct implementation
of the maintenance programme. This review should allow the NPPO to find and correct deficiencies,
incorporate any new and relevant information on the pest or associated pathways, and adjust and
improve the maintenance programme accordingly.
Traceability procedures for the movement of regulated articles should allow the verification of their
origin and conformity with the phytosanitary requirements set for the PFA.

5.    Data collection, documentation and record-keeping
The data from the surveillance (e.g. time of survey, number and type of plants inspected, number of
samples taken for inspection, number of samples taken for laboratory analysis, diagnostic protocols
used, data analysis methods used, results of the analyses, and other relevant information as required by
ISPM 6) should be stored and kept. To facilitate traceability and verification, this information should be
made available for as long as the PFA is based on these data.
The measures used to establish and maintain the PFA should be adequately documented. The
documentation should be reviewed regularly, updated as needed, and include any amendments to the
PFA maintenance programme. Records of the procedures to establish, implement and maintain
corrective actions should be kept as needed or for at least 24 months, depending on the biology of the
pest and the duration of the commodity being moved from the PFA.

6.    Communication and stakeholder engagement
Individuals, groups or organizations other than the NPPO of the country in which the PFA is situated
can also affect, or be affected by, the actions to establish and maintain the PFA. The NPPO may establish
partnerships with stakeholders, which may include seeking contributions of resources.
Information about the establishment and maintenance of the PFA, including information about the
methodology used, results of surveys and pest diagnostics, and other relevant information supporting
the PFA claim, should be made available on request to other NPPOs and, if appropriate, to relevant
stakeholders.
Maps and information about the measures applied to maintain the PFA may be communicated to relevant
stakeholders.
To achieve the support of the community, NPPOs are encouraged to raise public awareness about PFAs
in their territory, including the framework for reporting detections or cases of suspected presence of the
pest in the PFAs, measures applied in the PFAs, and the importance of maintaining the PFAs.

7.    Recognition of pest free areas
Recognition of PFAs should take place in accordance with ISPM 29 (Recognition of pest free areas and
areas of low pest prevalence).

 IPPC
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)
is an international plant-health agreement that aims to
protect global plant resources and facilitate safe trade.
The IPPC vision is that all countries have the capacity
to implement harmonized measures to prevent pest
introductions and spread, and minimize the impacts
of pests on food security, trade, economic growth, and
the environment.


Organization
» There are over 180 IPPC contracting parties.
» Each contracting party has a national plant protection
  organization (NPPO) and an official IPPC contact point.
» Ten regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs)
  have been established to coordinate NPPOs in various
  regions of the world.
» The IPPC Secretariat liaises with relevant international
  organizations to help build regional and national
  capacities.
» The secretariat is provided by the Food and Agriculture
  Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
