Adoption
This standard was first adopted by the Twenty-eighth Session of the FAO Conference in November
1995 as Code of conduct for the import and release of exotic biological control agents. The first revision
was adopted by the Seventh Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April
2005 as the present standard.

INTRODUCTION

Scope
This standard 1 provides guidelines for risk management related to the export, shipment, import and
release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms. It lists the related responsibilities of
contracting parties to the IPPC, national plant protection organizations (NPPOs) or other responsible
authorities, importers and exporters (as described in the standard). The standard addresses biological
control agents capable of self-replication (including parasitoids, predators, parasites, nematodes,
phytophagous organisms, and pathogens such as fungi, bacteria and viruses), as well as sterile insects
and other beneficial organisms (such as mycorrhizae and pollinators), and includes those packaged or
formulated as commercial products. Provisions are also included for import for research in quarantine
stations of non-indigenous biological control agents and other beneficial organisms.
The scope of this standard does not include living modified organisms, issues related to registration of
biopesticides, or microbial agents intended for vertebrate pest control.

Outline of Requirements
This standard is intended to facilitate the safe export, shipment, import and release of biological control
agents and other beneficial organisms. Responsibilities relating to this are held by contracting parties,
NPPOs or other responsible authorities, and by importers and exporters.
Contracting parties, or their designated authorities, should consider and implement appropriate
phytosanitary measures related to the export, shipment, import and release of biological control agents
and other beneficial organisms and, when necessary, issue related import permits.
As described in this standard, NPPOs or other responsible authorities should:
-     carry out pest risk analysis of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms prior to
      import or prior to release

       designated quarantine stations or mass-rearing facilities or, if appropriate, passed directly for
       release into the environment
-      encourage monitoring of release of biological control agents or beneficial organisms in order to
       assess impact on target and non target organisms.
Responsibilities of, and recommendations for, exporters include ensuring that consignments of
biological control agents and other beneficial organisms comply with phytosanitary import requirements
of importing countries and relevant international agreements, packaging consignments securely, and
providing appropriate documentation relating to biological control agents or other beneficial organisms.
Responsibilities of, and recommendations for, importers include providing appropriate documentation
relating to the target pest(s) and biological control agent or other beneficial organisms to the NPPO or
other responsible authority of the importing country.

BACKGROUND
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is based on securing common and effective action
to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products, and the promotion of
appropriate measures for their control (Article I of the IPPC). In this context, the provisions of the IPPC
extend to any organism capable of harbouring or spreading plant pests, particularly where international
transportation is involved (Article I of the IPPC).
The IPPC contains the following provision in relation to the regulation of biological control agents and
other beneficial organisms. Article VII.1 states:
           With the aim of preventing the introduction and/or spread of regulated pests into their territories,
           contracting parties shall have sovereign authority to regulate, in accordance with applicable
           international agreements, the entry of plants and plant products and other regulated articles and, to this
           end, may: ...
           (c) prohibit or restrict the movement of regulated pests into their territories;
           (d) prohibit or restrict the movement of biological control agents and other organisms of
                 phytosanitary concern claimed to be beneficial into their territories.

Section 4.1 of ISPM 20 (Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system) contains a reference
to the regulation of biological control agents; it states:
           Imported commodities that may be regulated include articles that may be infested or contaminated with
           regulated pests. ... The following are examples of regulated articles: ...
           -       pests and biological control agents.

This revision of ISPM 3 provides guidelines related to phytosanitary measures, as well as recommended
guidelines for safe usage of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms. In some cases, the
scope of these guidelines may be deemed to extend beyond the scope and provisions of the IPPC as
described above. For example, although the primary context of this standard relates to phytosanitary
concerns, “safe” usage as mentioned in the standard is intended to be interpreted in a broader sense, i.e.
minimizing other non-phytosanitary negative effects. Phytosanitary concerns may include the possibility
that newly introduced biological control agents may primarily affect other non-target organisms, but
thereby result in harmful effects on plant species, or plant health in habitats or ecosystems. However, it
is not intended that any aspects of this standard alter in any way the scope or obligations of the IPPC or
its ISPMs.
The structure of this revised standard broadly follows the same structure as the original ISPM 3 (Code
of conduct for the import and release of exotic biological control agents), and its content is based
primarily on risk management relating to the use of biological control agents and other beneficial
organisms. It is recognized that the existing standards on pest risk analysis (ISPM 2 (Framework for
pest risk analysis) and ISPM 11 (Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests)) provide the appropriate
fundamental processes for carrying out pest risk assessments for biological control agents and other
beneficial organisms. In particular, ISPM 11 includes provisions for pest risk assessment in relation to
environmental risks, and this aspect covers environmental concerns related to the use of biological
control agents.
The IPPC takes into account internationally approved principles governing the protection of the
environment (Preamble). Its purpose includes promoting appropriate phytosanitary measures
(Article I.1). When carrying out pest risk analysis in accordance with this and other appropriate ISPMs,
and in developing and applying related phytosanitary measures, contracting parties should also consider
the potential for broader environmental impacts resulting from releasing biological control agents and
other beneficial organisms 2 (for example, impacts on non-target invertebrates).
Most of this standard is based on the premise that a biological control agent or other beneficial organism
may be a potential pest itself, and in this sense Article VII.1(c) of the IPPC applies because contracting

2
  Available expertise, instruments and work in international fora with competence in the area of risks to the
environment should be taken into account as appropriate.

ISPM 3-6                                                                      International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and
release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms                                  ISPM 3

parties may prohibit or restrict the movement of regulated pests into their territories. In some situations,
biological control agents and other beneficial organisms may act as a carrier or pathway for plant pests,
hyperparasitoids, hyperparasites and entomopathogens. In this sense, biological control agents and other
beneficial organisms may be considered to be regulated articles as described in Article VII.1 of the IPPC
and ISPM 20.
Purpose of the standard
The objectives of the standard are to:
-     facilitate the safe export, shipment, import and release of biological control agents and other
      beneficial organisms by providing guidelines for all public and private bodies involved,
      particularly through the development of national legislation where it does not exist
-     describe the need for cooperation between importing and exporting countries so that:
      .       benefits to be derived from using biological control agents or other beneficial organisms
              are achieved with minimal adverse effects
      .       practices which ensure efficient and safe use while minimizing environmental risks due to
              improper handling or use are promoted.
Guidelines in support of these objectives are described that:
-    encourage responsible trade practices
-    assist countries to design regulations to address the safe handling, assessment and use of
     biological control agents and other beneficial organisms
-    provide risk management recommendations for the safe export, shipment, import and release of
     biological control agents and other beneficial organisms
-    promote the safe use of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms.

REQUIREMENTS

1.     Designation of Responsible Authority and Description of General Responsibilities
1.1    Contracting parties
Contracting parties should designate an authority with appropriate competencies (usually their NPPO)
to be responsible for export certification and to regulate the import or release of biological control agents
and other beneficial organisms, subject to relevant phytosanitary measures and procedures.
Contracting parties should have provisions for implementing appropriate phytosanitary measures for the
export, shipment, import or release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms.

1.2    General responsibilities
The NPPO or other responsible authority should establish procedures for the implementation of this
standard, including for the assessment of relevant documentation specified in section 4.
The NPPO or other responsible authority should:
-    carry out pest risk analysis prior to import or release of biological control agents and other
     beneficial organisms
-    ensure, when certifying exports, that the regulations of importing countries are complied with
-    provide and assess documentation as appropriate, relevant to the export, shipment, import or
     release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms
-    ensure that biological control agents and other beneficial organisms are taken either directly to
     designated quarantine stations or, if appropriate, passed to mass rearing facilities or directly for
     release into the environment
-    ensure that importers and, where appropriate, exporters meet their responsibilities

International Plant Protection Convention                                                          ISPM 3-7
                                                                  Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and
ISPM 3                                       release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms

-     consider possible impacts on the environment, such as impacts on non-target invertebrates.
The NPPO or other responsible authority should maintain communication and, where appropriate,
coordinate with relevant parties including other NPPOs or relevant authorities on:
-     characteristics of biological control agent and other beneficial organisms
-     assessment of risks including environmental risks
-     labelling, packaging and storage during shipment
-     dispatch and handling procedures
-     distribution and trade
-     release
-     evaluation of performance
-     information exchange
-     occurrence of unexpected and/or harmful incidents, including remedial action taken.

2.    Pest Risk Analysis
The NPPO of the importing country should determine whether an organism is required to be subjected
to pest risk analysis (PRA). The NPPO or other responsible authority may also be responsible for
ensuring that other national legislative requirements are met; however, these may not be IPPC
obligations.
Pest risk assessment should be conducted in accordance with ISPM 2 and/or Stage 2 of ISPM 11 as
appropriate, taking into account uncertainties, and potential environmental consequences, as provided
for in those standards. In addition to conducting pest risk assessment, contracting parties should also
consider possible impacts on the environment, such as impacts on non-target invertebrates.
Most contracting parties require PRA to be completed prior to import and technical justification, as
described in ISPM 20, such as through PRA, is required to determine if pests should be regulated and
the strength of phytosanitary measures to be taken against them. Where applicable, if pest risk
assessment of the proposed organism has not been undertaken or completed prior to import, it should be
completed prior to release (see section 7). However, it is recognized that biological control agents and
other beneficial organisms may need to be imported for research and evaluation in secure facilities prior
to release. ISPM 20 also states that contracting parties may make special provision for the import of
biological control agents and other beneficial organisms for scientific research, and that such imports
may be authorized subject to the provision of adequate safeguards. The NPPO should be prepared for
such imports with the expectation that, where necessary, a full PRA in accordance with ISPM 11 will
be completed prior to release. When non-phytosanitary risks are identified, these may need to be referred
to other appropriate authorities for possible action.
It may be important that further scientific investigations are carried out in the exporting country prior to
importing the biological control agents or other beneficial organisms in order to verify the accuracy and
reliability of the risk assessment. Among other options, and where appropriate, NPPOs or other
responsible authorities may consider possibilities for such scientific investigations, in cooperation with
the authorities of the exporting country and in accordance with relevant procedures and regulations.

3.    Responsibilities of Contracting Parties prior to Import
3.1   Responsibilities of the importing contracting party
The importing contracting party or its NPPO or other responsible authority should:
3.1.1 Promote awareness of, and compliance with this standard and introduce necessary phytosanitary
      measures to regulate the import, shipment or release of biological control agents and other
      beneficial organisms in its country, and make provision for effective enforcement.

 Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and
release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms                                 ISPM 3

3.1.2 Evaluate the documentation on the target pest and on the biological control agent and beneficial
      organisms supplied by the importer (see section 4) in relation to the acceptable level of risk. The
      contracting party should establish appropriate phytosanitary measures for import, shipment,
      quarantine stations (including approval of research facilities, and phytosanitary measures for
      confinement and disposal) or release of biological control agents appropriate to the assessed risk.
      If the biological control agent or other beneficial organism is already present in the country,
      regulation may only be needed to ensure there is no contamination or infestation of this organism,
      or that interbreeding with local genotypes of the same species does not result in new phytosanitary
      risks. Inundative release may be restricted for these reasons.
3.1.3 Issue regulations stating requirements to be fulfilled by the exporting country, the exporter and
      the importer 3. Where appropriate, these may include:
      -      the issuing of an accompanying authorizing document (import permit or licence)
      -      phytosanitary certification, in accordance with ISPM 12 (Phytosanitary certificates)
      -      a specific certification document
      -      authoritative identification of organisms during quarantine and provision of a reference
             specimen
      -      specification of the source of the biological control agent or other beneficial organism(s),
             including origin and/or point of production where relevant
      -      precautions to be taken against inclusion of natural enemies of the biological control agent
             or other beneficial organism and of contamination or infestation
      -      requirements regarding packaging for shipment during transport and storage
      -      procedures for the disposal of packaging
      -      means to validate documentation
      -      means to validate the contents of consignments
      -      conditions under which the package may be opened
      -      designation of point(s) of entry
      -      identification of the person or organization to receive the consignment
      -      requirements for the facilities in which the biological control agent or other beneficial
             organisms may be held.
3.1.4 Ensure that procedures are in place for the documentation of:
      -     pest risk analysis
      -     the import (identity, origins, dates)
      -     nurturing, rearing or multiplication
      -     release (quantities released, dates, locations)
      -     any other relevant data.
       Such records may be made available to the scientific community and the public, as may be
       appropriate, while protecting any proprietary rights to the data.
3.1.5 If appropriate, ensure entry of consignments, and processing where required, through quarantine
      stations. Where a country does not have secure quarantine stations, import through a quarantine
      station in a third country, recognized by the importing contracting party, may be considered.
3.1.6 Consider, through pest risk analysis, the risk of introducing other organisms associated with the
      biological control agent or beneficial organism. Considerations (keeping in mind the principles
      of necessity and minimal impact) should include phytosanitary measures requiring the culturing

  Provisions of other international agreements may address the import of biological control agents or other
beneficial organisms (for example the Convention on Biological Diversity).

International Plant Protection Convention                                                         ISPM 3-9
                                                                 Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and
ISPM 3                                      release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms

      of imported biological control agents and other beneficial organisms in quarantine before release.
      Culturing for at least one generation can help in ensuring purity of the culture and freedom from
      hyperparasites and pathogens or associated pests, as well as facilitating authoritative
      identification. This is particularly advisable when biological control agents and other beneficial
      organisms are collected from the wild.
3.1.7 Where possible, ensure the deposition in collections of authoritatively identified reference
      specimens of the imported biological control agent or other beneficial organism (and host(s)
      where appropriate). It is preferable to deposit a series of specimens, where available, to
      accommodate natural variation.
3.1.8 In the case of sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterile insect may be marked to differentiate it
      from the wild insect.
3.1.9 Consider, through pest risk analysis (consistent with the principles of necessity and minimal
      impact), if, after a first import or release, further imports of the same biological control agent or
      other beneficial organism may be exempted from some or all of the requirements for import. The
      publication of lists of approved and prohibited biological control agents and other beneficial
      organisms may also be considered. If appropriate, biological control agents that are prohibited
      should be included in lists of regulated pests (established and updated by contracting parties in
      accordance with the IPPC and ISPM 19 (Guidelines on lists of regulated pests).

3.2   Responsibilities of the NPPO of an exporting country
The NPPO of an exporting country should ensure that the phytosanitary import requirements of the
importing country are satisfied and that phytosanitary certificates are issued in accordance with ISPM 12
where required by the importing country for consignments of biological control agents or other
beneficial organisms, if these are considered as potential pests or pathways for plant pests.
The NPPO is also encouraged to follow the appropriate elements of this standard where the importing
country has no legislation concerning the import of biological control agents and other beneficial
organisms.

4.    Documentary Responsibilities of Importer prior to Import
4.1   Documentary requirements related to the target organism
Prior to the first importation, the importer of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms
should provide information as required by the NPPO or other responsible authority of the importing
contracting party. For all biological control agents or other beneficial organisms, this information
includes accurate identification of the target organism(s), generally at the species level. Where a
biological control agent intended to control a pest is being imported, the information on the target pest
may also include:
-      its world distribution and probable origin
-      its known biology and ecology
-      available information on its economic importance and environmental impact
-      possible benefits and any conflicting interests surrounding its use
-      known natural enemies, antagonists and other biological control agents or competitors of the
       target pest already present or used in the proposed release area or in other parts of the world.
For all biological control agents or other beneficial organisms, other information relevant to a PRA may
also be requested by the NPPO or other responsible authority of the importing contracting party.

release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms                                   ISPM 3


4.2    Documentary requirements related to the biological control agent or other
       beneficial organism
Prior to first import, the importer of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms should
coordinate with the exporter to provide documentation, accompanied by appropriate scientific
references, to the NPPO or other responsible authority of the importing contracting party with
information on the biological control agent or beneficial organism including:
-      sufficient characterization of the biological control agent or other beneficial organism to allow
       for its accurate identification, in general to the species level at minimum
-      a summary of all available information on its origin, world distribution, biology, natural enemies,
       hyperparasites, and impact in its area of distribution
-      available information on host specificity (in particular, a list of confirmed hosts) of the biological
       control agent or beneficial organism and any potential hazards posed to non-target hosts
-      description of natural enemies and contaminants of the agent and procedures required for their
       elimination from laboratory colonies. This includes, where appropriate, procedures to identify
       accurately and, if necessary, eliminate from the culture the host upon which the biological control
       agent or beneficial organism was cultured. Information on any phytosanitary measures taken prior
       to shipment should also be provided.

4.3    Documentary requirements related to potential hazards and contingency plans
Prior to first importation, the importer of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms is
encouraged to provide documentation to the NPPO or other responsible authority that:
-      identifies potential health hazards and analyzes the risks 4 posed to staff operatives exposed when
       handling biological control agents or other beneficial organisms under laboratory, production and
       application conditions.
-      details contingency plans or procedures already in existence, should the biological control agent
       or beneficial organism display unexpected adverse properties.

4.4    Documentary requirements related to research in quarantine
An importer of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms proposed for research in
quarantine should provide as much information as possible as described in points 4.1–4.3. However, it
is recognized that field collected organisms imported by researchers in initial shipments of potential
biological control agents may not be described with regard to their exact taxonomic identity, host range,
impact on non-target organisms, distribution, biology, impact in an area of distribution etc. This
information will be determined after candidate biological control agents are studied in quarantine.
The researcher, in conjunction with the quarantine station to be used, should also provide the following
information:
-     the nature of the material proposed for importation
-     the type of the research to be carried out
-     detailed description of the quarantine station (including security and the competency and
      qualifications of the staff)
-     an emergency plan that will be implemented in the case of an escape from the quarantine station.
This information may be required by the NPPO or other responsible authority prior to approval of the
research to be conducted. The NPPO or other responsible authority may verify the accuracy of the
documentation provided and examine the facilities, and may require modifications as necessary.

 Available expertise, instruments and work in international fora with competence in the area of risks to human
health should be taken into account as appropriate.

International Plant Protection Convention                                                          ISPM 3-11
                                                                 Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and
ISPM 3                                      release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms


5.    Responsibilities of Exporter
The exporter of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms is encouraged to ensure that:
-     all phytosanitary import requirements specified in the regulations of the importing country or on
      an import permit are complied with (see also section 3.2, which describes the related
      responsibilities of the NPPO)
-     all appropriate documentation accompanies the consignment
-     packaging is secure in order to prevent escape of the contents
-     organisms for SIT have been treated to achieve the required sterility for SIT purposes (e.g. using
      irradiation with the required minimum absorbed dose). The treatment(s) used and an indication
      of the effectiveness of sterilization should also be provided.

5.1   Specific responsibilities regarding organisms intended for inundative release
Exporters of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms for inundative release should
provide documentation on measures undertaken to ensure that levels of contamination acceptable to the
importing NPPO or other responsible authority are not exceeded.

6.    Responsibilities of the NPPO or Other Responsible Authority of the Importing
      Contracting Party upon Import
6.1   Inspection
Where required (see section 3.1.5) after checking the documentation, inspection should take place at an
officially nominated quarantine station.

6.2   Quarantine
The NPPO should ensure that biological control agents or other beneficial organisms are cultured or
reared in quarantine, if appropriate (see section 3.1.6), for as long as considered necessary.

6.3   Release
The NPPO or other responsible authority may allow biological control agents or other beneficial
organisms to be passed directly for release, provided that all conditions have been complied with
(particularly as described in section 3) and required documentary evidence is made available
(see section 4).

7.    Responsibilities of the NPPO or Other Responsible Authority before, upon and
      following Release
Prior to release, NPPOs or other responsible authorities are encouraged to communicate details of the
intended release that may affect neighbouring countries. To facilitate information sharing in this manner,
details of intended releases may also be communicated to relevant RPPOs prior to release.
If pest risk analysis was not undertaken prior to import in accordance with ISPM 2 and/or ISPM 11, it
should be undertaken prior to release, taking into account uncertainties, as provided for in those
standards. In addition to conducting pest risk assessment, contracting parties should also consider
possible impacts on the environment, such as impacts on non-target invertebrates.
The NPPO or other responsible authority may verify the effectiveness of sterilization treatment(s) prior
to release of sterile insects.

7.1   Release
The NPPO or other responsible authority should authorize and audit official requirements related to the
release of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms, e.g. requirements related to release



ISPM 3-12                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and
release of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms                               ISPM 3

only in specific areas. This audit may be used to alter the requirements related to import or release of
the organism.

7.2    Documentation
Documentation sufficient to allow trace-back of released biological control agents or other beneficial
organisms should be maintained by the NPPO or other responsible authority.

7.3    Monitoring and evaluation
The NPPO or other responsible authority may monitor the release of biological control agents or other
beneficial organisms in order to evaluate and, as necessary, respond to the impact on the target and non-
target organisms. Where appropriate, it should include a marking system to facilitate recognition of the
biological control agent (e.g. sterile insects) or other beneficial organism in comparison with the
organism in its natural state and environment.

7.4    Contingency plans
The NPPO or other responsible authority of the importing contracting party is responsible for developing
or adopting contingency plans or procedures, as appropriate, for use within the importing country.
Where problems are identified (i.e. unexpected harmful incidents), the NPPO or other responsible
authority should consider possible emergency actions and, where appropriate, ensure that they are
implemented and that all relevant parties are informed.

7.5    Communication
It is recommended that the NPPO or other responsible authority ensures that local users and suppliers
of biological control agents or other beneficial organisms, and farmers, farmer organizations and other
stakeholders, are kept sufficiently informed and educated on the appropriate measures for their use.

7.6    Reporting
The contracting party should abide by any reporting obligations under the IPPC, e.g. where an organism
used as a biological control agent or beneficial organism has shown pest characteristics.




International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 3-13
 IPPC
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is an
international plant health agreement that aims to protect
cultivated and wild plants by preventing the introduction and
spread of pests. International travel and trade are greater than
ever before. As people and commodities move around the
world, organisms that present risks to plants travel with them.

Organization
RR There are over 180 contracting parties to the IPPC.

RR Each contracting party has a national plant protection

   organization (NPPO) and an Official IPPC contact point.
RR Nine regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs) work

   to facilitate the implementation of the IPPC in countries.
RR IPPC liaises with relevant international organizations to

   help build regional and national capacities.
RR The Secretariat is provided by the Food and Agriculture

   Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
