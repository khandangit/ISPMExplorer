Adoption
This standard was first adopted by the Third Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary
Measures in April 2001 as Guidelines for phytosanitary certificates. The first revision of the standard
was adopted by the Sixth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March 2011. The
revised Appendix 1 was adopted by the Ninth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in
April 2014. A focused revision of ISPM 12 in relation to re-export was adopted by the Sixteenth Session
of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2022 as the present standard.

INTRODUCTION

Scope
This standard provides the requirements and guidelines for the preparation and issuance of phytosanitary
certificates (phytosanitary certificates for export and phytosanitary certificates for re-export).1
Specific guidance on requirements and components of a phytosanitary certification system to be
established by national plant protection organizations (NPPOs) is provided in ISPM 7 (Phytosanitary
certification system).

References
The present standard refers to International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs). ISPMs are
available on the International Phytosanitary Portal (IPP) at https://www.ippc.int/core-
activities/standards-setting/ispms.

Definitions
Definitions of phytosanitary terms used in this standard can be found in ISPM 5 (Glossary of
phytosanitary terms).

Outline of requirements
Phytosanitary certification is used to attest that consignments meet phytosanitary import requirements
and is undertaken by an NPPO. A phytosanitary certificate for export or for re-export can be issued only
by a public officer who is technically qualified and duly authorized by an NPPO.
A phytosanitary certificate for export is usually issued by the NPPO of the country where the plants,
plant products or other regulated articles were grown or processed. A phytosanitary certificate for re-
export is issued by the NPPO of the country of re-export (a country where the commodity has not been
grown or processed to change its nature) when the consignment has not been subjected to the risk of
infestation or contamination by pests regulated by the country of destination and meets the phytosanitary
import requirements of that country, and the original phytosanitary certificate or a certified copy of the
phytosanitary certificate (hereafter referred to as a “certified copy”) is available.
NPPOs shall use the model phytosanitary certificates of the IPPC.
Where the required phytosanitary information exceeds the space available on the phytosanitary
certificates, an attachment may be added with this information.



1
  The IPPC refers to a “phytosanitary certificate” for export purposes and a “phytosanitary certificate for re-export”
for re-export purposes. In order to keep the use of these terms simple and clear in this standard “phytosanitary
certificate for export” and “phytosanitary certificate for re-export” are used. The term “phytosanitary certificates”
(plural) is used to cover both types of certificate.

ISPM 12-6                                                              International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates                                                                                               ISPM 12



Phytosanitary certificates should accompany the consignment or may be transmitted by mail or other
means, or where agreed between countries, NPPOs may use electronic phytosanitary certificates, using
standardized language, structure of the message and exchange protocols.
Phytosanitary certificates may have a limited duration of validity. The NPPO of the exporting country
or the importing country may make relevant stipulations.
Specific procedures should be followed in the case of replacement phytosanitary certificates, certified
copies of phytosanitary certificates, and alterations to phytosanitary certificates. Invalid or fraudulent
phytosanitary certificates should not be accepted.
Specific consideration is given to situations of re-export, particularly when the country of re-export does
not require a phytosanitary certificate for importing the commodity but the country of destination
requires that specific phytosanitary measures have been applied in the country of origin.2

BACKGROUND
Phytosanitary certification is used to attest that consignments meet phytosanitary import requirements
and is applied to most plants, plant products and other regulated articles that are traded internationally.
Phytosanitary certification contributes to the protection of plants, including cultivated and
uncultivated/unmanaged plants and wild flora (including aquatic plants), habitats and ecosystems in the
importing countries. Phytosanitary certification also facilitates international trade in plants, plant
products and other regulated articles by providing an internationally agreed document and related
procedures.
Article V.2(a) of the IPPC stipulates how phytosanitary certificates should be issued:
       Inspection and other related activities leading to issuance of phytosanitary certificates shall be carried out
       only by or under the authority of the official national plant protection organization. The issuance of
       phytosanitary certificates shall be carried out by public officers who are technically qualified and duly
       authorized by the official national plant protection organization to act on its behalf and under its control
       with such knowledge and information available to those officers that the authorities of importing
       contracting parties may accept the phytosanitary certificates with confidence as dependable documents.

       [See also ISPM 7]

This was clarified at the FAO Conference in 1997 during adoption of the 1997 revision of the IPPC: “It
is understood that … ‘public officers who are technically qualified and duly authorized by the national
plant protection organization’ include officers from the national plant protection organization”. “Public”
in this context means employed by a level of government, not by a private company. “Include officers
from the national plant protection organization” means that the officer may be directly employed by the
NPPO, but does not have to be directly employed by the NPPO.
The IPPC also states requirements for the use of model phytosanitary certificates (in Article V.3):
       Each contracting party undertakes not to require consignments of plants or plant products or other regulated
       articles imported into its territories to be accompanied by phytosanitary certificates inconsistent with the
       models set out in the Annex to this Convention. Any requirements for additional declarations shall be
       limited to those technically justified.




2
  In this standard, except where stated otherwise, the requirements set out for issuing a phytosanitary certificate
for re-export consider only a country of origin (issuing a phytosanitary certificate for export), a country of re-
export (issuing a phytosanitary certificate for re-export) and a country of destination.

International Plant Protection Convention                                                                               ISPM 12-7
 ISPM 12                                                                             Phytosanitary certificates



REQUIREMENTS FOR PHYTOSANITARY CERTIFICATION

1.       Phytosanitary certificates
1.1      Purpose of phytosanitary certificates
Phytosanitary certificates are issued to attest that plants, plant products or other regulated articles meet
the phytosanitary import requirements of importing countries and are in conformity with the certifying
statement. Phytosanitary certificates may also be issued to support re-export certification to other
countries. Phytosanitary certificates should be issued only for these purposes.

1.2      Types and forms of phytosanitary certificates
In the Annex to the IPPC, there are two types of certificates: a “phytosanitary certificate” (see Annex 1
of this standard) for export purposes and a “phytosanitary certificate for re-export” (see Annex 2 of this
standard) for re-export purposes.3
A phytosanitary certificate for export is usually issued by the NPPO of the country of origin. A
phytosanitary certificate for export describes the consignment and, through a certifying statement,
additional declarations and treatment records, declares that the consignment meets phytosanitary import
requirements. A phytosanitary certificate for export may also be issued in certain re-export situations
for plants, plant products and other regulated articles originating in countries other than the country of
re-export if compliance with the phytosanitary import requirements can be attested by the country of re-
export (e.g. by inspection).
A phytosanitary certificate for re-export may be issued by the NPPO of the re-exporting country in the
case where the commodity in the consignment was not grown or processed to change its nature in that
country and only where an original phytosanitary certificate for export or a certified copy is available.
The phytosanitary certificate for re-export provides the link to the phytosanitary certificate issued in the
country of export and takes into account any changes in the pest risk associated with the consignment
that may have occurred in the country of re-export.
Procedures for managing the issuance of the two types of phytosanitary certificates and the systems that
ensure their legitimacy are the same.
According to Article V.2(b) of the IPPC, the IPPC model phytosanitary certificates provide standardized
wording that shall be followed for the preparation of phytosanitary certificates. The standardization of
the phytosanitary certificates is necessary to ensure consistency, that they are easily recognized, and that
essential information is reported. NPPOs are encouraged to use a single format for their phytosanitary
certificates for export and a single format for phytosanitary certificates for re-export and to place a
sample of the phytosanitary certificates’ format on the International Phytosanitary Portal (IPP)
(https://www.ippc.int) in a manner that prevents falsification.
Phytosanitary certificates can be in paper form or, where it is accepted by the NPPO of the importing
country, in electronic form.
Electronic phytosanitary certificates are the electronic equivalent of the wording and data of
phytosanitary certificates in paper form, including the certifying statement, transmitted by authenticated
and secure electronic means from the NPPO of the exporting country to the NPPO of the importing
country. Electronic phytosanitary certification does not constitute text processing or other electronic
generation of paper forms, which are then distributed non-electronically. Nor is it the transfer of an
electronic version of the paper certificate (e.g. through e-mail).




3
    See Scope, footnote 1, concerning terminology.

ISPM 12-8                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates                                                                      ISPM 12



NPPOs should apply safeguards against falsification of paper phytosanitary certificates, for example
special papers, watermarks or special printing. When electronic certification is used, appropriate
safeguards should also be applied.
Phytosanitary certificates are not valid until all requirements have been met and they are dated, signed
and stamped, sealed, marked or completed electronically by the NPPO of the exporting or re-exporting
country.

1.3    Attachments to phytosanitary certificates
If the information required to complete phytosanitary certificates exceeds the available space on the
form, an attachment may be added. The information in the attachment should only include what is
required on the phytosanitary certificates. All pages of attachments should bear the number of the
phytosanitary certificates and should be dated, signed and stamped in the same manner as required for
the phytosanitary certificates. Phytosanitary certificates should refer to any attachments in the
appropriate section. If an attachment has more than one page, the pages should be numbered and the
number of pages indicated on the phytosanitary certificates. Other documents such as the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) certificates may accompany the consignment
along with the phytosanitary certificate, but such documents should not be considered attachments to
the phytosanitary certificates nor should they be referenced on the phytosanitary certificate.

1.4    Electronic phytosanitary certificates
Electronic phytosanitary certificates may be issued where accepted by the NPPO of the importing
country.
When using electronic phytosanitary certificates NPPOs should develop systems that generate
certificates using standardized language, message structure and exchange protocols. Appendix 1
provides guidance on standardized language, message structure and exchange protocols.
Electronic phytosanitary certificates may be used subject to the following provisions:
-     The mode of issue, transmission and level of security is acceptable to the NPPO of the importing
      country and if relevant to NPPOs of other countries involved.
-     The information provided is consistent with the IPPC model phytosanitary certificates.
-     The purpose of phytosanitary certification under the IPPC is realized.
-     The identity of the issuing NPPO can be adequately established and authenticated.

1.5    Mode of transmission
Phytosanitary certificates should accompany the consignments for which they have been issued.
Phytosanitary certificates may also be transmitted separately by mail or other means if accepted by the
NPPO of the importing country. In the case of electronic phytosanitary certificates, they should be
directly available to the relevant NPPO officials. In all cases, phytosanitary certificates should be
available to the NPPO of the importing country upon the consignment’s arrival.

1.6    Duration of validity
The phytosanitary security of consignments may be lost after issuance of phytosanitary certificates and
therefore the NPPO of the exporting or re-exporting country may decide to restrict the duration of the
validity of phytosanitary certificates after issuance and prior to export.
The NPPO of the exporting or re-exporting country may assess the situation and define an appropriate
period of validity before export occurs, taking into account the likelihood of the consignment becoming
infested or contaminated prior to export or re-export. Such likelihood may be affected by packaging
(sealed carton or loose packing) and storage environment (open air or enclosed), type of commodity and
conveyance, time of year and type of pests. A phytosanitary certificate for export for which the period



International Plant Protection Convention                                                     ISPM 12-9
 ISPM 12                                                                            Phytosanitary certificates



of validity has expired may still be used for issuing a phytosanitary certificate for re-export, provided
that the consignment meets all the requirements set out in section 6.1.
NPPOs of importing countries may also stipulate as part of the phytosanitary import requirements the
duration for which phytosanitary certificates remain valid.

2.    Actions taken with issued phytosanitary certificates
2.1   Certified copies of phytosanitary certificates
A certified copy is a copy of the original of the phytosanitary certificate for export or re-export that is
validated (stamped, dated and countersigned) by the NPPO, indicating it is a true representative copy of
the original phytosanitary certificate. It may be issued upon request by the exporter. It does not replace
the original. Such copies are used primarily for re-export purposes.

2.2   Replacement of phytosanitary certificates
Phytosanitary certificates may be replaced at the request of an exporter for a consignment for which a
phytosanitary certificate has already been issued. This should be done only in exceptional circumstances
(e.g. damage to the phytosanitary certificates issued; change of addresses, country of destination or
points of entry; missing or incorrect information) and should be carried out by the NPPO of the country
that issued the phytosanitary certificates being replaced.
In all cases, the issuing NPPO should request exporters to return the original phytosanitary certificates
and any certified copies that have already been issued for the consignments.
Other requirements concerning replacement of phytosanitary certificates include:
-     Phytosanitary certificates returned for replacement should be retained by the NPPO of the issuing
      country and be cancelled. The new phytosanitary certificates should not have the same number as
      the certificate being replaced. The number of the original certificate should not be re-used.
-     When previously issued phytosanitary certificates cannot be returned and have left the care and
      control of the NPPO (for example because they are lost or in another country), the NPPO may
      decide that it is appropriate to issue a replacement certificate. The new phytosanitary certificate
      should not have the same number as the phytosanitary certificate being replaced but should refer
      to it by including an additional declaration stating that “This certificate replaces and cancels
      phytosanitary certificate no. [insert number] issued on [insert date]”.

2.3   Alterations to phytosanitary certificates
Alterations should be avoided as they may create uncertainty about the validity of phytosanitary
certificates. However, if alterations are necessary, they should be made only on the original
phytosanitary certificates by the issuing NPPO. Alterations should be minimal and should be stamped,
dated and countersigned by the issuing NPPO.

3.    Considerations for importing countries and NPPOs issuing phytosanitary
      certificates
NPPOs of importing countries may require phytosanitary certificates for regulated articles only. These
are usually plants and plant products but may include articles such as empty containers, vehicles and
organisms other than plants where phytosanitary measures are technically justified.
NPPOs of the importing countries should not require phytosanitary certificates for plant products that
have been processed to the point where they have no potential for introducing regulated pests, or for
other articles that do not require phytosanitary measures (see IPPC Article VI.2 and ISPM 32
(Categorization of commodities according to their pest risk)).
NPPOs should consult bilaterally when there are differences between their views regarding the technical
justification for requiring phytosanitary certificates. Requirements for phytosanitary certificates should

ISPM 12-10                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates                                                                       ISPM 12



respect the principles of transparency, non-discrimination, necessity and technical justification (see
ISPM 1 (Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary
measures in international trade)).

3.1    Unacceptable phytosanitary certificates
NPPOs of importing countries should not accept phytosanitary certificates that they determine to be
invalid or fraudulent. The NPPO of the declared country of issuance should be notified as soon as
possible regarding unacceptable or suspect phytosanitary certificates as described in ISPM 13
(Guidelines for the notification of non-compliance and emergency action). Where the NPPO of the
importing country suspects that phytosanitary certificates may be unacceptable, it may require the
prompt cooperation of the NPPO of the exporting or re-exporting country in determining the validity or
non-validity of the phytosanitary certificates. The NPPO of the exporting or re-exporting country should
take corrective action where necessary and review systems for the issuance of phytosanitary certificates
so as to ensure that a high level of confidence is associated with its phytosanitary certificates.

3.1.1 Invalid phytosanitary certificates
Phytosanitary certificates are invalid if, for example, they have or they are:
-     incomplete or incorrect information
-     false or misleading information
-     conflicting or inconsistent information
-     wording or information that is inconsistent with the model phytosanitary certificates
-     information added by unauthorized persons
-     unauthorized (not stamped, dated or countersigned) alterations or deletions
-     an expired period of validity unless used as a certified copy for re-export
-     illegible (e.g. badly written, damaged)
-     non-certified copies
-     transmitted through a mode of transfer unauthorized by the NPPO (for electronic phytosanitary
      certificates)
-     phytosanitary certification of plants, plant products and other regulated articles prohibited for
      import.
These are also reasons for rejecting phytosanitary certificates or for requesting additional information.

3.1.2 Fraudulent phytosanitary certificates
Fraudulent phytosanitary certificates typically include those:
-    issued on non-authorized forms
-    not dated, stamped, marked or sealed, and signed by the issuing NPPO
-    issued by persons who are not authorized public officers.
Fraudulent phytosanitary certificates are invalid. The NPPO issuing phytosanitary certificates should
have safeguards against their falsification. In the case of electronic phytosanitary certification,
safeguards against falsification are an element of the electronic certification mechanism. The NPPO of
the exporting country should take corrective action when notified of a non-compliance.




International Plant Protection Convention                                                     ISPM 12-11
 ISPM 12                                                                             Phytosanitary certificates



3.2   Phytosanitary import requirements for the preparation and issuance of
      phytosanitary certificates
Importing countries frequently specify phytosanitary import requirements that should be observed with
respect to the preparation and issuance of phytosanitary certificates. Examples of what an importing
country may require include:
-     that phytosanitary certificates be completed in a specific language or one of its listed languages
      (however, countries are encouraged to accept one of the official languages of FAO, preferably
      English)
-     the period of time allowed for issuance after inspection or treatment and the period of time
      between the issuance of phytosanitary certificates and the dispatch of the consignment from the
      exporting country
-     that phytosanitary certificates be completed by typing or if handwritten, be in legible capital letters
      (where the language allows it)
-     the units of measurement to be used in the description of the consignment and for other declared
      quantities.

4.    Specific considerations for the preparation and issuance of phytosanitary
      certificates
Phytosanitary certificates shall only be issued by public officers who are technically qualified and duly
authorized by the NPPO.
Phytosanitary certificates should only be issued if the NPPO is confident that the phytosanitary import
requirements are met.
Phytosanitary certificates should contain the necessary information to clearly identify the consignment
to which each relates.
Phytosanitary certificates should only contain information related to phytosanitary matters. They should
not include statements related to non-phytosanitary requirements such as animal or human health
matters, pesticide residues, radioactivity, commercial information (e.g. letters of credit), or quality.
To facilitate cross-referencing between phytosanitary certificates and documents not related to
phytosanitary certification (e.g. letters of credit, bills of lading, CITES certificates), notes may
accompany phytosanitary certificates that associate them with the identification code, symbol or
numbers of the relevant documents that require cross-referencing. Such notes should be used only when
necessary and should not be considered part of phytosanitary certificates.
All sections of the phytosanitary certificates should be completed. Where no entry is made, the term
“None” should be entered or the line should be blocked out or a line drawn through the section to prevent
unauthorized additions.
For re-export of consignments, the NPPO of the country of re-export may need specific information
from the country of origin in order to ensure compliance with the phytosanitary import requirements of
the country of destination. However, this may not be available on the phytosanitary certificate for export
(e.g. specific information for an additional declaration is missing on the phytosanitary certificate for
export, or a phytosanitary certificate for export itself was not required at import by the country of re-
export). In such cases, if the specific phytosanitary import requirements of the country of destination
cannot be met within the country of re-export, a phytosanitary certificate for re-export should not be
issued. However, the NPPO of the country of origin may support any subsequent re-export process as
follows:
-      Where a phytosanitary certificate for export is required by the country of re-export, the NPPO of
       the country of origin may, upon request by the NPPO of the re-exporting country or by exporters,
       provide additional phytosanitary information (e.g. the results of a growing season inspection) to
       that required by the country of re-export. Such information may be necessary for the issuance of

ISPM 12-12                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates                                                                                            ISPM 12



       phytosanitary certificates for re-export. This information should be placed in the additional
       declaration section, under the subheading “Additional official phytosanitary information” (see
       section 5).
-      Where a phytosanitary certificate for export is not required by the country of re-export, the NPPO
       of the country of origin may nevertheless issue a phytosanitary certificate for export upon request
       by exporters. This would be for consignments intended for re-export to other countries in order
       to provide additional phytosanitary information necessary for the issuance of phytosanitary
       certificates for re-export.
In both cases above, the country of re-export should appropriately address the considerations for re-
export situations set out in section 6.
Phytosanitary certificates should be issued before dispatch; however, they may also be issued after
dispatch of a consignment provided that:
-     the phytosanitary security of the consignment has been assured, and
-     the NPPO of the exporting country has undertaken sampling, inspection and treatments necessary
      to satisfy phytosanitary import requirements before dispatch of the consignment.
If these criteria are not met, phytosanitary certificates should not be issued.
In the case where phytosanitary certificates are issued after dispatch, the inspection date should be
indicated in the additional declaration section if required by the importing country.

5.     Guidelines and requirements for completing sections of a phytosanitary certificate
       for export
Information on completing the sections of the phytosanitary certificate for export is provided as follows:
[Headings in bold refer to the sections of the model certificate, see model in Annex 1]
No. __________
Each phytosanitary certificate for export should have a unique identification number, which allows for
trace-back of consignments, facilitates audits and serves for record-keeping.
Plant Protection Organization of ____________
The name of the country issuing the phytosanitary certificate for export should be listed here along with
the name of the NPPO.
TO: Plant Protection Organization(s) of ____________
The name of the importing country should be listed here. Where a transit country and the importing
country have specific phytosanitary requirements that include the need for a phytosanitary certificate
for export, the names of both countries should be listed and the transit country should be indicated. Care
should be taken to ensure that the phytosanitary import or transit requirements of each country are met
and appropriately indicated. In those cases where the consignment is imported and then re-exported to
another country, the names of both countries (i.e. the country of re-export and the country of destination)
may be inserted by the NPPO of the exporting country, provided that the phytosanitary import
requirements of both countries have been met.
                       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               I. Description of Consignment
Name and address of exporter: ____________
This information identifies the source of the consignment to facilitate its trace-back and audit by the
NPPO of the exporting country. The address of the exporter should be located in the exporting country.
The name and address of an exporter’s local agent or shipper should be used where an international
company with a foreign address is the exporter.


International Plant Protection Convention                                                                           ISPM 12-13
 ISPM 12                                                                             Phytosanitary certificates



Declared name and address of consignee: ____________
The name and address inserted here should be in sufficient detail to enable the NPPO of the importing
country to confirm the identity of the consignee and, where necessary, to be able to conduct trace-back
of non-compliant imports. Where the consignee is not known, “To order” may be used if the NPPO of
the importing country permits the use of the term and accepts any associated risks. The importing
country may require that the address of a consignee be a location in the importing country.
Number and description of packages: ____________
The number of packages and their description should be included. Sufficient detail should be included
in this section to enable the NPPO of the importing country to link the phytosanitary certificate for
export with the corresponding consignment. In some cases (e.g. grain and bulk timber), shipping
containers and/or railcars are considered the package and the number may be included (e.g. 10
containers). In cases of bulk shipments, the term “in bulk” may be used.
Distinguishing marks: ____________
Distinguishing marks on packages (e.g. lot numbers, serial numbers or brand names) and conveyance
identification numbers or names (e.g. container and railcar identification numbers or vessel name in the
case of bulk shipments) should be included if necessary for the identification of the consignment.
Place of origin: ____________
The place of origin refers to places where the commodity was grown or produced, and where it may
therefore have been infested or contaminated by pests regulated by the country of destination. In all
cases, the name of the country or countries of origin should be stated. Countries may also require that
the name or code of the pest free area, pest free place of production or pest free production site be
identified. Further details on the pest free area, pest free place of production or pest free production site
may be provided in the additional declaration section.
If the commodity was moved from the place of origin to a new place where it was repacked or stored,
and where it may therefore have been infested or contaminated by pests regulated by the country of
destination, this new place should also be declared under the place of origin section. Similarly, if the
commodity was moved from the place of origin to a new place where it was processed or treated, thereby
removing possible infestation or contamination, this new place should also be declared under the place
of origin section. In such cases, each country and place, where necessary, should be declared with the
initial place of origin in brackets, for example declared as “name of country of export (name of country
of origin)”.
If plants were imported into or moved within a country and have subsequently been grown for a specific
period of time (depending on the commodity concerned, but usually one growing season or more), these
plants may be considered to have changed their country or place of origin, provided that the pest risk
associated with them is affected only by that country or place of further growth.
If different lots within a consignment originate in different places or countries, all countries and, where
necessary, all places should be indicated. To assist with trace-back in such cases, the most relevant place
for undertaking trace-back may be identified, for example the exporting company where records are
stored.
Declared means of conveyance: ____________
This section refers to how the consignment is transported when leaving the certifying country. Terms
such as “ocean vessel”, “boat”, “aircraft”, “road”, “truck”, “rail”, “mail” and “carried by hand” may be
used. The ship’s name and voyage number or the aircraft’s flight number may be included if known.
The means of conveyance is generally as declared by the exporter. Often this will be only the first means
of conveyance used directly after issuance of the phytosanitary certificate for export. Consignments
frequently move in such a way that the means of conveyance can change, for example a container that
is transferred from a ship to a truck. If the distinguishing marks identify the consignment, it is sufficient
to declare only the first means of conveyance. This is then not necessarily the means of conveyance used
when arriving in the country of import.

ISPM 12-14                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates                                                                                   ISPM 12



Declared point of entry: ____________
This should be the first point of arrival in the country of destination, or if not known, the country name.
Where the consignment transits through another country this may need to be recorded if the country of
transit has phytosanitary requirements for transiting consignments. The entry point of the country of
transit, or if not known the country name, should be noted in brackets.
The point of entry is declared by the exporter at the time of issuance of the phytosanitary certificate for
export. This point of entry may change for various reasons, and entry into the country at a place other
than the declared point of entry should not normally be considered as non-compliance. However, when
the NPPO of the importing country prescribes specified points of entry in its phytosanitary import
requirements, then one of the specific points of entry should be declared and the consignment should
enter through that point.
Name of produce and quantity declared: ____________
This section should be sufficiently descriptive of the commodity and should include the name of the
plant, plant product or other regulated article, unit and the quantity as accurately as possible to enable
the NPPO of the importing country to verify the contents of the consignment. International codes may
be added to facilitate identification (e.g. Customs codes) and internationally recognized units and terms
should be used (e.g. metric system). Because different phytosanitary import requirements may apply to
the different intended uses (e.g. consumption as compared with propagation) or degree of processing
(e.g. fresh as compared with dried), the intended use or degree of processing should be specified. Entries
should not refer to trade names, sizes or other commercial terms.
Botanical name of plants: ____________
The information inserted here should identify plants and plant products using accepted scientific names,
at least to genus level but preferably to species level.
It may not be feasible to provide botanical names for certain regulated articles and products of complex
composition such as stock feeds. In these cases, the NPPOs of the importing and exporting countries
may agree on a suitable common name descriptor, or the words “Not applicable” or “N/A” should be
entered.
Certifying statement
           This is to certify that the plants, plant products or other regulated articles described herein
           have been inspected and/or tested according to appropriate official procedures and are
           considered to be free from the quarantine pests specified by the importing contracting party
           and to conform with the current phytosanitary requirements of the importing contracting party,
           including those for regulated non-quarantine pests.

           They are deemed to be practically free from other pests.* [*Optional clause]

In most instances specific phytosanitary import requirements exist or regulated pests are specified and
the certifying statement on the phytosanitary certificate for export is used to certify conformity with
these phytosanitary import requirements.
In instances where phytosanitary import requirements are not specific, the NPPO of the exporting
country may certify the general status of the consignment for any pests believed by it to be of
phytosanitary concern.
NPPOs of exporting countries may include the optional clause on their phytosanitary certificate for
export. NPPOs of importing countries cannot request that the optional clause be added.
“Appropriate official procedures” refers to procedures carried out by the NPPO or persons authorized
by the NPPO for purposes of phytosanitary certification. Such procedures should be in conformity with
ISPMs where appropriate. The procedures may be specified by the NPPO of the importing country
taking into account any relevant ISPMs.



International Plant Protection Convention                                                               ISPM 12-15
 ISPM 12                                                                                                     Phytosanitary certificates



“Considered to be free from quarantine pests” refers to freedom from pests in numbers or quantities that
can be detected by the application of phytosanitary procedures. It should not be interpreted to mean
absolute freedom in all cases but rather that quarantine pests are believed not to be present based on the
procedures used for their detection or elimination. It should be recognized that phytosanitary procedures
have inherent uncertainty and variability, and involve some probability that pests will not be detected or
eliminated. This uncertainty and probability should be taken into account in the specification of
appropriate procedures.
In some cases where irradiation treatments have been applied, live stages of target pests may be present
in the consignment. Providing the treatment has been applied in accordance with ISPM 18 (Guidelines
for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure) and the appropriate treatment has been applied to
achieve the required response, the validity of this part of the certifying statement is not compromised
because the detection of live stages of the target pest is not considered as non-compliance.
“Phytosanitary requirements”, as provided by the importing country, are officially prescribed conditions
to be met in order to prevent the introduction and/or spread of pests. Phytosanitary import requirements
should be specified in advance by the NPPO of the importing country in legislation, regulations or
elsewhere (e.g. import permits and bilateral and other arrangements).
“Importing contracting party” refers to governments that have adhered to the IPPC.

                                               II. Additional Declaration
Additional declarations provide specific additional information on a consignment in relation to regulated
pests and regulated articles. Additional declarations should be kept to a minimum and be concise.
NPPOs of the importing countries should keep under review the need for additional declarations and
they should not require additional declarations with the required wording similar to that already included
in the certifying statement on the phytosanitary certificate for export. The text of additional declarations
may be specified in phytosanitary regulations, import permits or bilateral agreements. Treatments should
not be indicated in this section but in section III of the phytosanitary certificate for export.
Additional declarations should be only those containing specific phytosanitary information required by
the NPPO of the importing country or requested by the exporter for future phytosanitary certification
purposes and they should not repeat information that is otherwise noted in the certifying statement or in
the treatment section. In cases where phytosanitary import requirements allow for several alternative
measures, the NPPO of the exporting country should specify in its additional declaration which option
has been applied.
Appendix 2 provides examples of text for different types of additional declarations that are often
required by NPPOs of importing countries. When NPPOs consider it necessary to require or provide an
additional declaration they are encouraged to use the standard wording as provided in Appendix 2.
In the case where an import permit is required by the importing country, the import permit number may
be referred to here to assist cross-referencing.
Where a phytosanitary certificate for export is issued after dispatch of the consignment, and if required
by the importing country, the date of inspection should be added to this section (see also applicable
conditions in section 4).
Where additional official phytosanitary information is included for future phytosanitary certification
purposes, such as re-export (see section 4), such information should be presented in this section. This
information should be clearly separated from the additional declaration required by the importing
country and should follow the added subheading “Additional official phytosanitary information”.

                             III. Disinfestation and/or Disinfection Treatment
Entries should be as follows:
Date
The date that the treatment was applied to the consignment. Months should be written in full so that the
month, day and year are not confused.
Treatment
The type of treatment applied to the consignment (e.g. heat treatment, irradiation).
Chemical (active ingredient)
The active ingredient of the chemical applied in the treatment.
Duration and temperature
The duration of the treatment and temperature in the treatment.
Concentration
The concentration and dosage of the treatment applied.
Additional information
Any relevant additional information.
Treatments indicated should only be those that are acceptable to the importing country and are
performed or initiated (in the case of transit) in the exporting country under supervision or authority of
the NPPO of the exporting country to meet the phytosanitary import requirements.
For irradiation treatments, the provisions of ISPM 18 should be considered.
                              ----------------------------------------------------------
Stamp of organization
The official seal, stamp or mark identifying the issuing NPPO should be included on the phytosanitary
certificate for export. The NPPO of the exporting country should normally use a uniform stamp, seal or
mark within a country. It should be added by the authorized public officer upon completion of the form
or may be printed on the phytosanitary certificate for export. Care should be taken to ensure that the
stamp, seal or mark does not obscure essential information.
Name of authorized officer, date and signature
The name of the authorized public officer should be printed, typed, stamped or handwritten in legible
upper case (capital) letters (where the language allows it). The date should also be printed, typed,
stamped or handwritten in legible upper case (capital) letters (where the language allows it). The names
of months should be written in full so that the month, day and year are not confused.
Although sections of the phytosanitary certificate for export may be completed in advance, the date
stated should be the date of issuance. Upon request of the NPPO of the importing country, the NPPO of
the exporting country should be able to verify the authenticity of signatures of authorized public officers.
The phytosanitary certificate for export shall be signed only after it is duly completed.
When electronic phytosanitary certificates are issued, the certification data should be authenticated by
the issuing NPPO. This authentication process is equivalent to the signature of the authorized public
officer and stamp, seal or mark. Authenticated electronic certification data is equivalent to the completed
paper document of the phytosanitary certificate for export.
Financial liability statement
The inclusion of a statement of the financial liability of the NPPO on the phytosanitary certificate for
export is optional and at the discretion of the NPPO of the exporting country.


International Plant Protection Convention                                                       ISPM 12-17
 ISPM 12                                                                                    Phytosanitary certificates



6.     Considerations for re-export situations
6.1    Considerations for issuing a phytosanitary certificate for re-export
The phytosanitary certificate for re-export (see model in Annex 2) is the same as the phytosanitary
certificate for export (see model in Annex 1) except for the text covering the certifying statement. In the
certifying statement on the phytosanitary certificate for re-export, the NPPO of the country of re-export
indicates, by inserting ticks in the appropriate boxes, whether the original phytosanitary certificate or a
certified copy is attached to the phytosanitary certificate for re-export, whether the consignment has
been repacked or not, whether the containers are original or new, and whether an additional inspection
has been done.
When a consignment is imported into a country and then re-exported to another, the NPPO of the country
of re-export, upon request by exporters, may issue a phytosanitary certificate for re-export only if all of
the following requirements are met:
-      All the plants, plant products or other regulated articles of the consignment for re-export have
       been imported.
-      All the plants, plant products or other regulated articles of the consignment for re-export are
       covered and accompanied by an original phytosanitary certificate (or phytosanitary certificates)
       for export or a certified copy (or certified copies).
-      The plants, plant products or other regulated articles of the consignment for re-export have not
       been grown, or processed to change their nature,4 in the country of re-export.
-      The consignment has not been infested or contaminated by pests regulated by the country of
       destination.
In addition to the above requirements, the NPPO should only issue a phytosanitary certificate for re-
export if it is confident that the phytosanitary import requirements of the country of destination are met.

6.1.1 Examination of the phytosanitary import requirements of the country of
      destination
Before issuing a phytosanitary certificate for re-export, the NPPO should first examine the phytosanitary
import requirements of the country of destination and determine if they can be met.
The country of re-export may not be able to meet some of the phytosanitary import requirements (e.g.
growing season inspection, soil testing) of the country of destination. However, the country of re-export
may still be able to issue a phytosanitary certificate for re-export if:
-     information on compliance with such requirements has been declared on the phytosanitary
      certificate for export by the country of origin; or
-     an alternative phytosanitary action can be performed by the country of re-export (such as an
      additional inspection, a test or a treatment) that is considered equivalent and in accordance with
      the phytosanitary import requirements of the country of destination.

6.1.2 Repacking, reloading, storing, splitting or combining consignments
A phytosanitary certificate for re-export may still be issued if the consignment has been repacked,
reloaded, stored, split up or combined with other imported consignments, provided that it has not been
exposed to infestation or contamination by pests regulated by the country of destination. If a risk of
infestation or contamination is identified, an additional inspection or a test should be carried out to verify



4
  The decisive criterion for judging whether a plant, plant product or other article has been processed to change its
nature is the categorization used in the phytosanitary import requirements of the country of destination. If the
phytosanitary import requirements for the unprocessed commodity and the processed commodity are the same,
then a phytosanitary certificate for re-export may be issued.

ISPM 12-18                                                             International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates                                                                          ISPM 12



that the consignment has not been infested or contaminated by pests regulated by the country of
destination.
If the consignment is split up and the resulting consignments are re-exported separately to one or
multiple countries, then phytosanitary certificates for re-export and certified copies of the original
phytosanitary certificate for export should accompany all such consignments.
Where imported consignments are combined, the original phytosanitary certificates for export or
certified copies of these must be available for all the regulated articles forming part of the consignment
for re-export, and all those articles must meet the phytosanitary import requirements of the country of
destination.

6.1.3 General considerations
By issuing a phytosanitary certificate for re-export, the NPPO of the re-exporting country is providing
assurance to the country of destination related to the handling (e.g. splitting, combining, repacking,
reloading, storing) of the consignment in the country of re-export.
Additional declarations on phytosanitary certificates for re-export, where required, should be based on
the activities of the NPPO of the country of re-export. Additional declarations from the original
phytosanitary certificate or certified copies should not be transferred to phytosanitary certificates for re-
export.
The phytosanitary certificate for re-export shall be signed only after it is duly completed.
The original phytosanitary certificate for export or a certified copy should accompany the consignment
together with the phytosanitary certificate for re-export.
In the case of consignments re-exported multiple times, all the original phytosanitary certificates for re-
export or certified copies of these should also accompany the consignment. The phytosanitary certificate
number indicated in the certifying statement of the phytosanitary certificate for re-export should be the
number of the phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of the most recent country of re-export.

6.2    Considerations for issuing a phytosanitary certificate for export in certain re-
       export cases
In those cases where one or more of the requirements set out in section 6.1 for issuing a phytosanitary
certificate for re-export cannot be met, a phytosanitary certificate for re-export should not be issued.
Instead, the NPPO of the country of re-export, upon request by exporters, may carry out inspection,
testing, treatment or another appropriate phytosanitary action, and if the NPPO is confident that the
phytosanitary import requirements of the country of destination are met, it may issue a phytosanitary
certificate for export. The country of origin should still be indicated in brackets in the place of origin
section of the phytosanitary certificate for export.
The NPPO of the re-exporting country may attach the original phytosanitary certificate, or a certified
copy thereof, if it contains information that was used to complete the phytosanitary certificate for export.
In this case, the number of the certificate may be referred to in the additional declaration section of the
phytosanitary certificate for export to attest compliance with the phytosanitary import requirements of
the country of destination (e.g. growing season inspection, soil testing) that cannot be met by the country
of re-export.

6.3    Other considerations for re-export situations
When re-exports routinely occur, or are started, suitable procedures for satisfying the phytosanitary
import requirements of both the country of re-export and the country of destination may be agreed
between the NPPOs of the countries of origin and re-export. This may include an exchange of written
correspondence between the respective NPPOs on phytosanitary actions performed in the country of
origin (e.g. growing season inspection, soil testing) that provides the assurance required for the country

 ISPM 12                                                                            Phytosanitary certificates



of re-export to certify consignments in accordance with the phytosanitary import requirements of the
country of destination.

7.    Considerations for transit
If a consignment is in transit through a country, the NPPO of the country of transit is not involved unless
risks for the country of transit have been identified (ISPM 25 (Consignments in transit)).
If the phytosanitary security of the consignment has been compromised during transit, and the NPPO of
the country of transit receives a request to become involved, the NPPO may perform phytosanitary
certification for export in accordance with the provisions described in this standard.
A change of means of conveyance during transit or the transport of two or more consignments in one
conveyance should not be considered a reason to issue phytosanitary certificates unless the phytosanitary
security of the consignment is compromised.
Importing countries may have specific phytosanitary import requirements (e.g. require seals, specific
packaging) addressed to the country of export for the import of consignments to be moved in transit
through other countries if specific risks have been identified.

         This appendix was adopted by the Ninth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2014.
                   This appendix is for reference purposes only and is not a prescriptive part of the standard.

APPENDIX 1: Electronic phytosanitary certificates, information on standard XML
schemas and exchange mechanisms (2014)

Introduction
Electronic phytosanitary certificates are the electronic equivalents of phytosanitary certificates in paper
form and may be used if they are accepted by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the
importing country. When electronic phytosanitary certificates are issued by the NPPO of the exporting
or re-exporting country, they should be made directly available to the NPPO of the importing country.
All the requirements and procedures in this standard apply to electronic phytosanitary certificates.
When using electronic phytosanitary certificates, NPPOs should develop a system for the issuance,
transmission and receipt of electronic phytosanitary certificates that uses Extensible Markup Language
(XML), standardized message structure and contents, and standardized exchange protocols.
This appendix provides guidance on these elements and refers to a page on the IPPC website 5 that
provides links to further details – both IPPC and external websites and documents – on the information
contained in this appendix. These links are referred to in the text as “Link 1”, “Link 2” and so forth.
The system should include the following harmonized components to generate electronic phytosanitary
certificates.

1.       XML message structure
NPPOs should use the World Wide Web Consortium’s (WC3) XML (Link 1) for exchange of electronic
phytosanitary certification data.
The phytosanitary XML message structure is based on the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation
and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) XML schema (Link 2) and
on XML data mapping, which indicates where the phytosanitary certification data should be placed in
the XML schema.
The phytosanitary XML data mapping enables the generation of an electronic phytosanitary certificate
for export (Link 3) and an electronic phytosanitary certificate for re-export (Link 4).

2.       XML schema contents
To facilitate automatic electronic communication and processing of phytosanitary certification data,
NPPOs are encouraged to use standardized (harmonized) terms, codes and text for the data elements
associated with the XML message for electronic phytosanitary certificates.
The use of free (i.e. non-standardized) text should be limited when appropriate codes are available.
For dates and country names, harmonized text is available and no free text is anticipated to be required.
For scientific names of plants and pests, consignment description, treatments, additional declarations
and points of entry, extensive lists of harmonized terms, codes and text are being developed and will be
available. Free text may be inserted if the appropriate term, text or value does not appear in the lists.
The process for maintaining and updating the lists of harmonized terms is being developed and will be
described on the IPPC website5 NPPOs will be requested to submit proposals for new harmonized terms
using this process.

For data elements other than those above, no harmonization of terms and text is needed and therefore
free text may be entered.
Further details on the information to be entered for the data elements in the XML message are provided
in the following subsections.

2.1   Country names
For the names of countries (i.e. the country of origin, export, re-export, transit and destination) it is
encouraged that the two-letter country codes of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
(Link 6) be used.

2.2   Scientific names of plants and pests
For the scientific names of the plants in the consignment, the plants from which plant products were
derived, and the regulated pests, the use of the database of scientific names (Link 7) is encouraged.

2.3   Description of consignment
The type of commodity and the type of packaging should be included in the description of the
consignment. It is encouraged that the commodity be described using IPPC commodity terminology
(Link 8). It is also encouraged that the type of packaging be described using the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Recommendation 21 (Link 9).
Other elements of the description of the consignment may include, where possible:
-     weight, volume and height (which is encouraged to be described using UNECE
      Recommendation 20 (Link 10))
-     declared means of conveyance (which is encouraged to be described using UNECE
      Recommendation 19 (Link 15))
-     declared point of entry and country name (which is encouraged to be described using the United
      Nations Code for Trade and Transportation Locations (UN/LOCODE) (Link 14)).

2.4   Treatments
It is encouraged that treatment types be specified using the IPPC’s harmonized terms for treatment types
(Link 11). Active ingredients are encouraged to be specified using the pesticide index of the Codex
Alimentarius (Link 12). Other parameters (e.g. concentration, dosage, temperature, and duration of
exposure) are encouraged to be described using UNECE Recommendation 20 (Link 10).

2.5   Additional declarations
Recommended standardized wording for additional declarations is provided in Appendix 2 and it is
encouraged to be described using IPPC codes for additional declarations (Link 13). Free text may be
used to supplement the additional declarations indicated on the IPPC website or to describe additional
declarations that have not been standardized.

2.6   Name of authorized officer
The name of the authorized officer issuing the electronic phytosanitary certificates should be included
in each types of electronic phytosanitary certificate.

3.    Secure data exchange mechanisms
NPPOs are responsible for the security of their national information technology (IT) system used for
generating electronic phytosanitary certificates.
During transmission, the data should be encrypted to ensure that the electronic exchange of the electronic
phytosanitary certification data between NPPOs is secure and authenticated. NPPOs should use a secure



ISPM 12-24                                                      International Plant Protection Convention
 Phytosanitary certificates – Appendix 1                                                           ISPM 12



protocol with a minimum 128-bit encryption. Before transmission, the electronic phytosanitary
certification data may be subjected to additional encryption that remains intact after transmission.
Transmission of data over the Internet from the NPPO of the exporting country to the NPPO of the
importing country should be performed using secure IT mechanisms (e.g. Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP), Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), File Transfer Protocol
(FTP), Representative State Transfer (REST)) using systems that are mutually compatible.
The NPPO of the exporting country should make available to the exporter the actual electronic
phytosanitary certificate number for the consignment.
Communication on the status of the message exchange between NPPOs should follow UN/CEFACT
recommended standard messages.
NPPOs are responsible for developing and maintaining their systems for exchanging electronic
phytosanitary certification data. In cases where an exchange mechanism is suspended due to
maintenance or unexpected system failure, the NPPO should notify other NPPOs as soon as possible.

4.     Electronic phytosanitary certificate for re-export
In paper-only systems, the original phytosanitary certificate for export or its certified copy should be
available as an attachment to the phytosanitary certificate for re-export. In the situation where paper and
electronic phytosanitary certificates are both in use, the following requirements should be met.

4.1    Electronic phytosanitary certificate for re-export with original phytosanitary
       certificate for export in electronic form
When both the phytosanitary certificate for export and the phytosanitary certificate for re-export are in
electronic form, the electronic phytosanitary certificate for export should be attached electronically to
the electronic phytosanitary certificate for re-export.

4.2    Electronic phytosanitary certificate for re-export with original phytosanitary
       certificate in paper form
When the original phytosanitary certificate for export is in paper form and the phytosanitary certificate
for re-export is in electronic form, a scan of the original phytosanitary certificate for export (in PDF or
other non-editable format) should be attached to the electronic phytosanitary certificate for re-export.

4.3    Paper phytosanitary certificate for re-export with original phytosanitary
       certificate in electronic form
When the original phytosanitary certificate for export is in electronic form and the phytosanitary
certificate for re-export is in paper form, the electronic phytosanitary certificate for export should be
printed and validated by the NPPO of the country of re-export by stamping, dating and countersigning.
The printed version of the electronic phytosanitary certificate for export becomes a certified copy and
should then, in paper form, be attached to the phytosanitary certificate for re-export.

5.     Management of electronic phytosanitary certificates issued by NPPOs
5.1    Retrieval issues
If the NPPO of the importing country is unable to retrieve the electronic phytosanitary certificates, the
NPPO of the exporting country should resubmit the original electronic phytosanitary certificates at the
request of the NPPO of the importing country.




International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 12-25
 ISPM 12                                                                Phytosanitary certificates – Appendix 1



5.2   Alteration and replacement
If any of the information in electronic phytosanitary certificates needs to be altered after their issuance,
the original electronic phytosanitary certificates should be revoked and replacement electronic
phytosanitary certificates (Link 5) with alterations should be issued as described in this standard.

5.3   Cancelled dispatch
If the NPPO of the exporting country becomes aware of a consignment that is not dispatched after the
issuance of electronic phytosanitary certificates, the NPPO of the exporting country should revoke the
associated electronic phytosanitary certificates.

5.4   Certified copy
Certified copies of electronic phytosanitary certificates are printouts of the electronic phytosanitary
certification data that are validated (stamped, dated and countersigned) by an NPPO attesting the
authenticity of the data.
The printouts should be in the format that follows the standardized wording provided by the IPPC model
phytosanitary certificates and recognized as phytosanitary certificates. However, the printouts may be
XML data in XML format if accepted by the NPPO of the importing country.

6.    Declared name and address of consignee
In the case of paper phytosanitary certificates, for “Declared name and address of consignee” the term
“To order” may be used in instances where the consignee is not known and the NPPO of the importing
country permits use of the term.
With electronic phytosanitary certificates, the consignment information may arrive in the importing
country well before the consignment arrives, which will allow pre-entry verification of the electronic
phytosanitary certification data.
Instead of using the “To order” option, NPPOs are encouraged to require the electronic phytosanitary
certificates to include the name and address of a contact person in the importing country responsible for
the consignment.
