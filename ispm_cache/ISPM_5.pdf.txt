Adoption
This standard was first recommended for publication as an international standard by the FAO Committee
of Experts on Phytosanitary Measures in 1996, and published in 1997. The first version of the glossary
as ISPM 5 was adopted by the Second Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures
in 1999. It has undergone repeated modifications since then. The current edition of ISPM 5 arises from
amendments adopted by the Eighteenth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April
2024.
Supplement 1 was first adopted by the Third Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary
Measures in April 2001. The first revision of Supplement 1 was adopted by the Seventh Session of the
Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March 2012. Supplement 2 was adopted by the Fifth Session
of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2003. Appendix 1 was adopted by the
Fourth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March–April 2009.

INTRODUCTION

Scope
This reference standard is a listing of terms and definitions with specific meaning for phytosanitary
systems worldwide. It has been developed to provide a harmonized internationally agreed vocabulary
associated with the implementation of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and
International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs).
Within the context of the IPPC and its ISPMs, all references to plants should be understood to continue
to include algae and fungi, consistent with the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and
plants.

Purpose
The purpose of this reference standard is to increase clarity and consistency in the use and understanding
of terms and definitions which are used by contracting parties for official phytosanitary purposes, in
phytosanitary legislation and regulations, as well as for official information exchange.

References
The references below correspond to the approval of terms and definitions, as indicated in the definitions.

Outline of reference
The purpose of this standard is to assist national plant protection organizations (NPPOs) and others in
information exchange and the harmonization of vocabulary used in official communications and
legislation pertaining to phytosanitary measures. The present version incorporates revisions agreed as a
result of the approval of the International Plant Protection Convention (1997) and terms added through
the adoption of additional International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs).
The glossary contains all terms and definitions approved until the Eighteenth Session of the Commission
on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM, 2024). References in square brackets refer to the approval of the term
and definition, and not to subsequent adjustments in translation.
As in previous editions of the glossary, terms in definitions are printed in bold to indicate their relation
to other glossary terms and to avoid unnecessary repetition of elements described elsewhere in the
glossary. Derived forms of words that appear in the glossary (e.g. inspected from inspection) are also
considered glossary terms.

SUPPLEMENT 1: Guidelines on the interpretation and application of the concepts of
“official control” and “not widely distributed”

INTRODUCTION

Scope
This supplement provides guidance on:
-     the official control of regulated pests; and
-     determination of when a pest is considered to be present but not widely distributed, for the
      decision on whether a pest qualifies as a quarantine pest.

References
The present standard refers to ISPMs. ISPMs are available on the International Phytosanitary Portal (IPP
– https://www.ippc.int).

Definition
Official control is defined as:
The active enforcement of mandatory phytosanitary regulations and the application of mandatory
phytosanitary procedures with the objective of eradication or containment of quarantine pests or for the
management of regulated non-quarantine pests.

BACKGROUND
The words “present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled” express an essential
concept in the definition of quarantine pest. According to that definition, a quarantine pest must always
be of potential economic importance to an endangered area. In addition, it must either meet the criterion
of not being present in that area or it must meet the combined criteria of being present but not widely
distributed and subject to official control.
The Glossary of phytosanitary terms defines official as “established, authorized or performed by an
NPPO” and control as “suppression, containment or eradication of a pest population”. However, for
phytosanitary purposes, the concept of official control is not adequately expressed by the combination
of these two definitions.
The purpose of this supplement is to describe more precisely the interpretation of:
-     the concept of official control and its application in practice for quarantine pests that are present
      in an area as well as for regulated non-quarantine pests; and
-     the concept of “present but not widely distributed and under official control” for quarantine pests.
“Not widely distributed” is not a term included in the description of pest status listed in ISPM 8.

REQUIREMENTS

1.     General requirements
Official control is subject to ISPM 1, in particular the principles of non-discrimination, transparency,
equivalence of phytosanitary measures and pest risk analysis.


ISPM 5-24                                                                International Plant Protection Convention
 Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Supplement 1                                                          ISPM 5



1.1   Official control
Official control includes:
-     eradication and/or containment in the infested area(s);
-     surveillance in the endangered area(s);
-     restrictions related to the movement into and within the regulated area(s) including phytosanitary
      measures applied at import.
All official control programmes have elements that are mandatory. At minimum, programme evaluation
and pest surveillance are required in official control programmes to determine the need for and effect of
control to justify phytosanitary measures applied at import for the same purpose. Phytosanitary measures
applied at import should be consistent with the principle of non-discrimination (see section 2.2 below).
For quarantine pests, eradication and containment may have an element of suppression. For regulated
non-quarantine pests, suppression may be used to avoid unacceptable economic impact as it applies to
the intended use of plants for planting.

1.2   Not widely distributed
“Not widely distributed” is a concept referring to a pest’s occurrence and distribution within an area. A
pest may be categorized as present and widely distributed in an area or not widely distributed, or absent.
In pest risk analysis (PRA), the determination of whether a pest is not widely distributed is carried out
in the pest categorization step. Transience means that a pest is not expected to establish and therefore is
not relevant to the concept of “not widely distributed”.
In the case of a quarantine pest that is present but not widely distributed, the importing country should
define the infested area(s) and the endangered area(s). When a quarantine pest is considered not widely
distributed, this means that the pest is limited to parts of its potential distribution and there are areas free
from the pest that are at risk of economic loss from its introduction or spread. These endangered areas
do not need to be contiguous but may consist of several distinct parts. In order to justify the statement
of a pest being not widely distributed, a description and delimitation of the endangered areas should be
made available if requested. There is a degree of uncertainty attached to any categorization of
distribution. The categorization may also change over time.
The area in which the pest is not widely distributed should be the same as the area for which the
economic impact applies (i.e. the endangered area) and where the pest is under or being considered for
official control. The decision that a pest is a quarantine pest, including consideration of its distribution,
and placing that pest under official control, is typically made with respect to an entire country. However,
in some instances it may be more appropriate to regulate a pest as a quarantine pest in parts of a country
rather than in the whole country. It is the potential economic importance of the pest for those parts that
has to be considered in determining phytosanitary measures. Examples of when this may be appropriate
are countries whose territories include one or more islands or other cases where there are natural or
artificially created barriers to pest establishment and spread, such as large countries in which specified
crops are restricted by climate to well-defined areas.

1.3   Decision to apply official control
A national plant protection organization (NPPO) may choose whether or not to officially control a pest
of potential economic importance that is present but not widely distributed, taking into account relevant
factors from PRA, for example the costs and benefits of regulating the specific pest, and the technical
and logistical ability to control the pest within the defined area. If the pest is not subjected to official
control, it does not then qualify as a quarantine pest.

2.    Specific requirements
The specific requirements to be met relate to pest risk analysis, technical justification, non-
discrimination, transparency, enforcement, mandatory nature of official control, area of application, and
NPPO authority and involvement in official control.

2.1   Technical justification
Domestic requirements and phytosanitary import requirements should be technically justified and result
in non-discriminatory phytosanitary measures.
Application of the definition of a quarantine pest requires knowledge of potential economic importance,
potential distribution and official control programmes (ISPM 2). The categorization of a pest as present
and widely distributed or present but not widely distributed is determined in relation to its potential
distribution. This potential distribution represents the areas where the pest could become established if
given the opportunity, i.e. its hosts are present and environmental factors such as climate and soil are
favourable. ISPM 11 provides guidance on the factors to be considered in assessing the probability of
establishment and spread when conducting a pest risk analysis. In the case of a pest that is present but
not widely distributed, the assessment of potential economic importance should relate to the areas where
the pest is not established.
Surveillance should be used to determine the distribution of a pest in an area as a basis for the further
consideration of whether the pest is not widely distributed. ISPM 6 provides guidance on surveillance,
and includes provisions on transparency. Biological factors such as pest life cycle, means of dispersal
and rate of reproduction may influence the design of surveillance programmes, the interpretation of
survey data and the level of confidence in the categorization of a pest as not widely distributed. The
distribution of a pest in an area is not a static condition. Changing conditions or new information may
necessitate reconsideration of whether a pest is not widely distributed.

2.2   Non-discrimination
The principle of non-discrimination between domestic requirements and phytosanitary import
requirements is fundamental. In particular, requirements for imports should not be more stringent than
the effect of official control in an importing country. There should therefore be consistency between
domestic requirements and phytosanitary import requirements for a defined pest:
-      Import requirements should not be more stringent than domestic requirements.
-      Domestic and import requirements should be the same or have an equivalent effect.
-      Mandatory elements of domestic and import requirements should be the same.
-      The intensity of inspection of imported consignments should be the same as equivalent processes
       in domestic control programmes.
-      In the case of non-compliance, the same or equivalent phytosanitary actions should be taken on
       imported consignments as are taken domestically.
-      If a tolerance level is applied within a domestic official control programme, the same tolerance
       level should be applied to equivalent imported material. In particular, if no action is taken in the
       domestic official control programme because the pest incidence does not exceed the tolerance
       level concerned, then no action should be taken for an imported consignment if the pest incidence
       does not exceed that same tolerance level. Compliance with import tolerance levels is generally
       determined by inspection or testing at entry, whereas compliance with the tolerance level for
       domestic consignments should be determined at the last point where official control is applied.
-      If downgrading or reclassifying is permitted within a domestic official control programme, similar
       options should be available for imported consignments.

2.3   Transparency
Domestic requirements for official control and the phytosanitary import requirements should be
documented and made available, on request.

ISPM 5-26                                                        International Plant Protection Convention

2.4   Enforcement
The domestic enforcement of official control programmes should be equivalent to the enforcement of
phytosanitary import requirements. Enforcement should include:
-     a legal basis;
-     operational implementation;
-     evaluation and review;
-     phytosanitary action in the case of non-compliance.

2.5   Mandatory nature of official control
Official control is mandatory in the sense that all persons involved are legally bound to perform the
actions required. The scope of official control programmes for quarantine pests is completely mandatory
(e.g. procedures for eradication campaigns), whereas the scope for regulated non-quarantine pests is
mandatory only in certain circumstances (e.g. official certification programmes).

2.6   Area of application
An official control programme can be applied at national, subnational or local area level. The area of
application of official control measures should be specified. Any phytosanitary import requirements
should have the same effect as the domestic requirements for official control.

2.7   NPPO authority and involvement in official control
Official control should:
-     be established or recognized by the contracting party or the NPPO under appropriate legislative
      authority;
-     be performed, managed, supervised or, at minimum, audited/reviewed by the NPPO;
-     have enforcement assured by the contracting party or the NPPO;
-     be modified, terminated or lose official recognition by the contracting party or the NPPO.
Responsibility and accountability for official control programmes rests with the contracting party.
Agencies other than the NPPO may be responsible for aspects of official control programmes, and
certain aspects of official control programmes may be the responsibility of subnational authorities or the
private sector. The NPPO should be fully aware of all aspects of official control programmes in its
country.

 ISPM 5                                                                 Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Supplement 2


     This supplement was adopted by the Fifth Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2003.
                                    The supplement is a prescriptive part of the standard.

SUPPLEMENT 2: Guidelines on the understanding of “potential economic importance”
and related terms including reference to environmental considerations

1.       Purpose and scope
These guidelines provide the background and other relevant information to clarify potential economic
importance and related terms, so that such terms are clearly understood and their application is consistent
with the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the International Standards for
Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs). These guidelines also show the application of certain economic
principles as they relate to the IPPC’s objectives, in particular in protecting uncultivated/unmanaged
plants, wild flora, habitats and ecosystems with respect to invasive alien species that are pests.
These guidelines clarify that the IPPC:
-     can account for environmental concerns in economic terms using monetary or non-monetary
      values;
-     asserts that market impacts are not the sole indicator of pest impact;
-     maintains the right of contracting parties to adopt phytosanitary measures with respect to pests
      for which the economic damage caused to plants, plant products or ecosystems within an area
      cannot be easily quantified.
They also clarify, with respect to pests, that the scope of the IPPC covers the protection of cultivated
plants in agriculture, horticulture and forestry, uncultivated/unmanaged plants, wild flora, habitats and
ecosystems.

2.       Background
The IPPC has historically maintained that the adverse consequences of pests, including those concerning
uncultivated/unmanaged plants, wild flora, habitats and ecosystems, are measured in economic terms.
References to the terms economic effects, economic impacts, potential economic importance and
economically unacceptable impact and the use of the word economic in the IPPC and in ISPMs has
resulted in some misunderstanding of the application of such terms and of the focus of the IPPC.
The scope of the convention applies to the protection of wild flora resulting in an important contribution
to the conservation of biological diversity. However, it has been misinterpreted that the IPPC is only
commercially focused and limited in scope. It has not been clearly understood that the IPPC can account
for environmental concerns in economic terms. This has created issues of consistency with other
agreements, including the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

3.       Economic terms and environmental scope of the IPPC and ISPMs
The economic terms found in the IPPC and ISPMs may be categorized as follows.
Terms requiring judgement to support policy decisions:
-    potential economic importance (in the definition for quarantine pest);
-    economically unacceptable impact (in the definition for regulated non-quarantine pest);
-    economically important loss (in the definition for endangered area).
Terms related to evidence that supports the above judgements:
-    limit the economic impact (in the definition for phytosanitary regulation and the agreed
     interpretation of phytosanitary measure);
-    economic evidence (in the definition for pest risk analysis);


ISPM 5-28                                                                  International Plant Protection Convention
 Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Supplement 2                                                         ISPM 5



-     cause economic damage (in Article VII.3 of the IPPC, 1997);
-     direct and indirect economic impacts (in ISPM 11 and ISPM 16);
-     economic consequences and potential economic consequences (in ISPM 11);
-     commercial consequences and non-commercial consequences (in ISPM 11).
ISPM 11 notes in section 2.1.1.5 with respect to pest categorization, that there should be a clear
indication that the pest is likely to have an unacceptable economic impact, including environmental
impact, in the PRA area. Section 2.3 of the standard describes the procedure for assessing potential
economic consequences of a pest introduction. Pest effects may be considered to be direct or indirect.
Section 2.3.2.2 addresses analysis of commercial consequences. Section 2.3.2.4 provides guidance on
the assessment of the non-commercial and environmental consequences of pest introduction. It
acknowledges that certain types of effects may not apply to an existing market that can be easily
identified, but it goes on to state that the impacts could be approximated with an appropriate non-market
valuation method. This section notes that if a quantitative measurement is not feasible, then this part of
the assessment should at least include a qualitative analysis and an explanation of how the information
is used in the PRA. Environmental or other undesirable effects of control measures are covered in
section 2.3.1.2 (Indirect pest effects) as part of the analysis of potential economic consequences. Where
a pest risk is found to be unacceptable, section 3.4 provides guidance on the selection of pest risk
management options, including measurements of cost-effectiveness, feasibility and least trade
restrictiveness.
In April 2001 the ICPM recognized that under the IPPC’s existing mandate, to take account of
environmental concerns, further clarification should include consideration of the following five
proposed points relating to potential environmental risks of pests:
-     reduction or elimination of endangered (or threatened) native plant species;
-     reduction or elimination of a keystone plant species (a species which plays a major role in the
      maintenance of an ecosystem);
-     reduction or elimination of a plant species which is a major component of a native ecosystem;
-     causing a change to plant biological diversity in such a way as to result in ecosystem
      destabilization;
-     resulting in control, eradication or management programmes that would be needed if a quarantine
      pest was introduced, and impacts of such programmes (e.g. pesticides, non-indigenous predators
      or parasites) on biological diversity.
Thus it is clear, with respect to plant pests, that the scope of the IPPC covers the protection of cultivated
plants in agriculture, horticulture and forestry, uncultivated/unmanaged plants, wild flora, habitats and
ecosystems.

4.    Economic considerations in PRA
4.1   Types of economic effect
In PRA, economic effects should not be interpreted to be only market effects. Goods and services not
sold in commercial markets can have economic value, and economic analysis encompasses much more
than the study of market goods and services. The use of the term economic effects provides a framework
in which a wide variety of effects (including environmental and social effects) may be analysed.
Economic analysis uses a monetary value as a measure to allow policy makers to compare costs and
benefits from different types of goods and services. This does not preclude the use of other tools such
as qualitative and environmental analyses that may not use monetary terms.

4.2   Costs and benefits
A general economic test for any policy is to pursue the policy if its benefit is at least as large as its cost.
Costs and benefits are broadly understood to include both market and non-market aspects. Costs and
benefits can be represented by both quantifiable measurements and qualitative measurements. Non-

International Plant Protection Convention                                                           ISPM 5-29
 ISPM 5                                                              Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Supplement 2



market goods and services may be difficult to quantify or measure but nevertheless are essential to
consider.
Economic analysis for phytosanitary purposes can only provide information with regard to costs and
benefits, and does not judge if one distribution is necessarily better than another distribution of costs
and benefits of a specific policy. In principle, costs and benefits should be measured regardless to whom
they occur. Given that judgements about the preferred distribution of costs and benefits are policy
choices, these should have a rational relationship to phytosanitary considerations.
Costs and benefits should be counted whether they occur as a direct or indirect result of a pest
introduction or if a chain of causation is required before the costs are incurred or the benefits realized.
Costs and benefits associated with indirect consequences of pest introductions may be less certain than
costs and benefits associated with direct consequences. Often, there is no monetary information about
the cost of any loss that may result from pests introduced into natural environments. Any analysis should
identify and explain uncertainties involved in estimating costs and benefits and assumptions should be
clearly stated.

5.     Application
The following criteria should be met before a pest is deemed to have potential economic importance:1
-     a potential for introduction in the PRA area;
-     the potential to spread after establishment;
-     a potential harmful impact on plants, for example:
           crops (for example loss of yield or quality),
           the environment, for example damage to ecosystems, habitats or species,
           some other specified value, for example recreation, tourism, aesthetics.
As stated in section 3, environmental damage, arising from the introduction of a pest, is one of the types
of damage recognized by the IPPC. Thus, with respect to the third criterion above, contracting parties
to the IPPC have the right to adopt phytosanitary measures even with respect to a pest that only has the
potential for environmental damage. Such action should be based upon a pest risk analysis that includes
the consideration of evidence of potential environmental damage. When indicating the direct and
indirect impact of pests on the environment, the nature of the harm or losses arising from a pest
introduction should be specified in pest risk analysis.
In the case of regulated non-quarantine pests, because such pest populations are already established,
introduction in an area of concern and environmental effects are not relevant criteria in the consideration
of economically unacceptable impacts (see ISPM 16 and ISPM 21).




1
 With respect to the first and second criteria, IPPC (1997) Article VII.3 states that for pests that may not be capable
of establishment, measures taken against these pests must be technically justified.

               This appendix is for reference purposes only and is not a prescriptive part of the standard.

APPENDIX TO SUPPLEMENT 2
This appendix provides additional clarification of some terms used in this supplement.
Economic analysis: It primarily uses monetary values as a measure to allow policy makers to compare
costs and benefits from different types of goods and services. It encompasses more than the study of
market goods and services. Economic analysis does not prevent the use of other measures that do not
use a monetary value; for example, qualitative or environmental analysis.
Economic effects: This includes market effects as well as non-market effects, such as environmental and
social considerations. Measurement of the economic value of environmental effects or social effects
may be difficult to establish. For example, the survival and well-being of another species or the value
of the aesthetics of a forest or a jungle. Both qualitative and quantitative worth may be considered in
measuring economic effects.
Economic impacts of plant pests: This includes both market measures as well as those consequences
that may not be easy to measure in direct economic terms, but which represent a loss or damage to
cultivated plants, uncultivated plants or plant products.
Economic value: This is the basis for measuring the cost of the effect of changes (e.g. in biodiversity,
ecosystems, managed resources or natural resources) on human welfare. Goods and services not sold in
commercial markets can have economic value. Determining economic value does not prevent ethical or
altruistic concerns for the survival and well-being of other species based on cooperative behaviour.
Qualitative measurement: This is the valuation of qualities or characteristics in other than monetary or
numeric terms.
Quantitative measurement: This is the valuation of qualities or characteristics in monetary or other
numeric terms.

     This appendix was adopted by the Fourth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March–April 2009.
                   The appendix is for reference purposes only and is not a prescriptive part of the standard.

APPENDIX 1: Terminology of the Convention on Biological Diversity in relation to the
Glossary of phytosanitary terms

1.       Introduction
Since 2001, it has been made clear that the scope of the IPPC extends to risks arising from pests that
primarily affect the environment and biological diversity, including harmful plants. The Technical Panel
for the glossary, which reviews ISPM 5 (Glossary of phytosanitary terms, hereinafter referred to as the
glossary), therefore examined the possibility of adding new terms and definitions to the standard to
cover this area of concern. In particular, it considered the terms and definitions that are in use by the
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),* with a view to adding them to the glossary, as has
previously been done in several cases for the terminology of other intergovernmental organizations.
However, study of the terms and definitions available from the CBD has shown that they are based on
concepts different from those of the IPPC, so that similar terms are given distinctly different meanings.
The CBD terms and definitions could not accordingly be used directly in the glossary. It was decided
instead to present these terms and definitions in the present Appendix to the glossary, providing
explanations of how they differ from IPPC terminology.
This Appendix is not intended to provide a clarification of the scope of the CBD, nor of the scope of the
IPPC.

2.       Presentation
In relation to each term considered, the CBD definition is first provided. This is placed alongside an
“Explanation in IPPC context”, in which, as usual, glossary terms (or derived forms of glossary terms)
are shown in bold. These explanations may also include CBD terms, in which case these are also in
bold and followed by “(CBD)”. The explanations constitute the main body of this Appendix. Each is
followed by notes, providing further clarification of some of the difficulties.

3.       Terminology
3.1      “Alien species”

    CBD definition                                          Explanation in IPPC context
    A species, subspecies or lower taxon,                   An alien2 species (CBD) is an individual3 or
    introduced outside its natural past1 or present         population, at any life stage, or a viable part of an
    distribution; includes any part, gametes, seeds,        organism that is non-indigenous to an area and
    eggs, or propagules of such species that might          that has entered4 by human agency5 into the area
    survive and subsequently reproduce

Notes:
1
  The qualification concerning “past and present” distribution is not relevant for IPPC purposes, since
the IPPC is concerned only with existing situations. It does not matter that the species was present in
the past if it is present now. The word “past” in the CBD definition presumably allows for the re-
introduction of a species into an area where it has recently become extinct and thus a reintroduced
species would presumably not be considered an alien species.
2
 “Alien” refers only to the location and distribution of an organism compared with its natural range. It
does not imply that the organism is harmful.

*
  The terms and definitions discussed in this document have resulted from discussion on invasive alien species by
the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity).

ISPM 5-32                                                                International Plant Protection Convention
 Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Appendix 1                                                        ISPM 5


3
 The CBD definition emphasizes the physical presence of individuals of a species at a certain time,
whereas the IPPC concept of occurrence relates to the geographical distribution of the taxon in general.
4
   For CBD purposes, an alien species is already present in the area that is not within its native
distribution (see Introduction below). The IPPC is more concerned with organisms that are not yet
present in the area of concern (i.e. quarantine pests). The term “alien” is not appropriate for them, and
terms such as “exotic”, “non-indigenous” or “non-native” have been used in ISPMs. To avoid confusion,
it would be preferable to use only one of these terms, in which case “non-indigenous” would be suitable,
especially as it can accompany its opposite “indigenous”. “Exotic” is not suitable because it presents
translation problems.
5
 A species that is non-indigenous and has entered an area through natural means is not an alien species
(CBD). It is simply extending its natural range. For IPPC purposes, such a species could still be
considered as a potential quarantine pest.

3.2      “Introduction”

    CBD definition                                 Explanation in IPPC context
    The movement by human agency, indirect or      The entry of a species into an area where it is non-
    direct, of an alien species6 outside of its    indigenous, through movement by human agency,
    natural range (past or present). This          either directly from an area where the species is
    movement can be either within a country or     indigenous, or indirectly8 (by successive movement
    between countries or areas beyond national     from an area where the species is indigenous through
    jurisdiction7                                  one or several areas where it is not)

Notes:
6
  The CBD definition suggests that introduction (CBD) concerns an alien species (CBD), and thus a
species that has already entered the area. However, it may be supposed, on the basis of other documents
made available by CBD, that this is not so, and that a non-indigenous species entering for the first time
is being introduced (CBD). For CBD, a species can be introduced (CBD) many times, but for IPPC a
species, once established, cannot be introduced again.
7
    The issue of “areas beyond national jurisdiction” is not relevant for the IPPC.
8
 In the case of indirect movement, it is not specifically stated in the definition whether all the movements
from one area to another must be introductions (CBD) (i.e. by human agency, intentional or
unintentional), or whether some can be by natural movement. This question arises, for example, where
a species is introduced (CBD) into one area and then moves naturally to an adjoining area. It seems
that this may be considered as an indirect introduction (CBD), so that the species concerned is an alien
species (CBD) in the adjoining area, despite the fact that it entered it naturally. In the IPPC context, the
intermediate country, from which the natural movement occurs, has no obligation to act to limit the
natural movement, though it may have obligations to prevent intentional or unintentional introduction
(CBD) if the importing country concerned establishes corresponding phytosanitary measures.

3.3      “Invasive alien species”

    CBD definition                                   Explanation in IPPC context
    An alien species whose introduction and/or An invasive12 alien species (CBD) is an alien
    spread threaten9 biological diversity10, 11 species (CBD) that by its establishment or spread
                                                has become injurious to plants13, or that by risk
                                                analysis (CBD)14 is shown to be potentially
                                                injurious to plants




International Plant Protection Convention                                                        ISPM 5-33
 ISPM 5                                                          Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Appendix 1



Notes:
9
  The word “threaten” does not have an immediate equivalent in IPPC language. The IPPC definition of
a pest uses the term “injurious”, while the definition of a quarantine pest refers to “economic
importance”. ISPM 11 makes it clear that quarantine pests may be “injurious” to plants directly, or
indirectly (via other components of ecosystems), while Supplement 2 of the glossary explains that
“economic importance” depends on a harmful impact on crops, or on the environment, or on some other
specific value (recreation, tourism, aesthetics).
10
   Invasive alien species (CBD) threaten “biological diversity”. This is not an IPPC term, and the
question arises whether it has a scope corresponding to that of the IPPC. “Biological diversity” would
then have to be given a wide meaning, extending to the integrity of cultivated plants in agro-ecosystems,
non-indigenous plants that have been imported and planted for forestry, amenity or habitat
management, and indigenous plants in any habitat, whether “man-made” or not. The IPPC does protect
plants in any of these situations, but it is not clear whether the scope of the CBD is as wide; some
definitions of “biological diversity” take a much narrower view.
11
  On the basis of other documents made available by CBD, invasive alien species may also threaten
“ecosystems, habitats or species”.
12
  The CBD definition and its explanation concern the whole term invasive alien species and do not
address the term “invasive” as such.
13
   The context of the IPPC is the protection of plants. It is clear that there are effects on biological
diversity that do not concern plants, and so there are invasive alien species (CBD) that are not relevant
to the IPPC. The IPPC is also concerned with plant products, but it is not clear to what extent the CBD
considers plant products as a component of biological diversity.
14
  For the IPPC, organisms that have never entered the endangered area can also be considered as
potentially injurious to plants, as a result of pest risk analysis.

3.4   “Establishment”

 CBD definition                                       Explanation in IPPC context
 The process15 of an alien species in a new habitat The establishment of an alien species (CBD) in
 successfully producing viable offspring16 with a a habitat in the area it has entered, by successful
 likelihood of continued survival                   reproduction

Notes:
15
   Establishment (CBD) is a process, not a result. It seems that a single generation of reproduction can
be establishment (CBD), provided the offspring have a likelihood of continued survival (otherwise
there would be a comma after “offspring”). The CBD definition does not express the IPPC concept of
“perpetuation for the foreseeable future”.
16
  It is not clear how far “offspring” applies to organisms that propagate themselves vegetatively (many
plants, most fungi, other microorganisms). By using “perpetuation”, the IPPC avoids the question of
reproduction or replication of individuals altogether. It is the species as a whole that survives. Even the
growth of long-lived individuals to maturity could be considered to be perpetuation for the foreseeable
future (e.g. plantations of a non-indigenous plant).




ISPM 5-34                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
 Glossary of phytosanitary terms – Appendix 1                                                       ISPM 5



3.5   “Intentional introduction”

 CBD definition                                       Explanation in IPPC context
 Deliberate movement and/or17 release by Deliberate movement of a non-indigenous species
 humans of an alien species outside its natural into an area, including its release into the
 range                                          environment18

Notes:
17
   The “and/or” of the CBD definition is difficult to understand.
18
  Under most phytosanitary import regulatory systems the intentional introduction of regulated pests is
prohibited.

3.6   “Unintentional introduction”

 CBD definition                                   Explanation in IPPC context
 All other introductions which are not Entry of a non-indigenous species with a traded
 intentional                           consignment, which it infests or contaminates, or
                                       by some other human agency including pathways
                                       such as passengers’ baggage, vehicles, artificial
                                       waterways19

Notes:
19
   The prevention of unintentional introduction of regulated pests is an important focus of phytosanitary
import regulatory systems.

3.7   “Risk analysis”

 CBD definition                                        Explanation in IPPC context
 1) the assessment of the consequences20 of the        Risk analysis (CBD)22 is: 1) evaluation of the
 introduction and of the likelihood of                 probability of establishment and spread, within
 establishment of an alien species using science-      an area23, of an alien species (CBD) that has
 based information (i.e. risk assessment), and         entered that area, 2) evaluation of the associated
 2) the identification of measures that can be         potential undesirable consequences, and
 implemented to reduce or manage these risks           3) evaluation and selection of measures to reduce
 (i.e. risk management), taking into account socio-    the risk of such establishment and spread
 economic and cultural considerations21

Notes:
20
   It is not clear what kinds of consequences are considered.
21
  It is not clear at what stages in the process of risk analysis (CBD) socio-economic and cultural
considerations are taken into account (during assessment, or during management, or both). No
explanation can be offered in relation to ISPM 11 or Supplement 2 of ISPM 5.
22
  This explanation is based on the IPPC definitions of pest risk assessment and pest risk management,
rather than on that of pest risk analysis.
23
   It is unclear whether risk analysis (CBD) may be conducted prior to entry, in which case the
probability of introduction may also need to be assessed, and measures evaluated and selected to reduce
the risk of introduction. It may be supposed (on the basis of other documents made available by CBD)
that risk analysis (CBD) can identify measures restricting further introductions, in which case it relates
more closely to pest risk analysis.

4.    Other concepts
The CBD does not propose definitions of other terms, but does use a number of concepts that do not
seem to be considered in the same light by the IPPC and the CBD, or are not distinguished by the IPPC.
These include:
-     border controls
-     quarantine measures
-     burden of proof
-     natural range or distribution
-     precautionary approach
-     provisional measures
-     control
-     statutory measures
-     regulatory measures
-     social impact
-     economic impact.

 IPPC
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC)
is an international plant-health agreement that aims to
protect global plant resources and facilitate safe trade.
The IPPC vision is that all countries have the capacity
to implement harmonized measures to prevent pest
introductions and spread, and minimize the impacts
of pests on food security, trade, economic growth, and
the environment.


Organization
» There are over 180 IPPC contracting parties.
» Each contracting party has a national plant protection
  organization (NPPO) and an official IPPC contact point.
» Ten regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs)
  have been established to coordinate NPPOs in various
  regions of the world.
» The IPPC Secretariat liaises with relevant international
  organizations to help build regional and national
  capacities.
» The secretariat is provided by the Food and Agriculture
  Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
