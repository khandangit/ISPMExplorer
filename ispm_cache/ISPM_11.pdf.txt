    Adoption
    ISPM 11 (Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests) was adopted by the Third Session of the Interim
    Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2001. In April 2003, the Fifth Session of the Interim
    Commission on Phytosanitary Measures adopted a supplement to ISPM 11 on analysis of environmental
    risk and agreed that it should be integrated into ISPM 11. This resulted in ISPM 11 Rev. 1 (Pest risk
    analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks). In April 2004, the Sixth Session
    of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures adopted a supplement on pest risk analysis for
    living modified organisms (LMOs) and agreed that it should be integrated into ISPM 11 Rev. 1 (Pest
    risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified
    organisms). The supplementary text on environmental risks is marked with “S1” and the supplementary
    text on LMOs is marked with “S2”.
    The Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures acknowledges the collaboration and support of the
    Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as the participation of experts from Parties
    to the Convention, in the preparation of the supplements to ISPM 11.

    Annex 4 on pest risk analysis for plants as quarantine pests, together with associated changes in the core
    text of the standard, was adopted by the Eighth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures
    in April 2013.

    INTRODUCTION

    Scope
    The standard provides details for the conduct of pest risk analysis (PRA) to determine if pests are
    quarantine pests. It describes the integrated processes to be used for risk assessment as well as the
    selection of risk management options.
S1 It also includes details regarding the analysis of risks of plant pests to the environment and biological
   diversity, including those risks affecting uncultivated/unmanaged plants, wild flora, habitats and
   ecosystems contained in the PRA area. Some explanatory comments on the scope of the IPPC in regard
   to environmental risks are given in Annex 1.
S2 It includes guidance on evaluating potential phytosanitary risks to plants and plant products posed by
   LMOs. This guidance does not alter the scope of ISPM 11 but is intended to clarify issues related to the
   PRA for LMOs. Some explanatory comments on the scope of the IPPC in regard to PRA for LMOs are
   given in Annex 2.

    Specific guidance on conducting PRA for plants as quarantine pests is provided in Annex 4.

Outline of Requirements
The objectives of a PRA are, for a specified area, to identify pests and/or pathways of quarantine concern
and evaluate their risk, to identify endangered areas, and, if appropriate, to identify risk management
options. PRA for quarantine pests follows a process defined by three stages:
-     Stage 1 (initiating the process) involves identifying the pest(s) and pathways that are of quarantine
      concern and should be considered for risk analysis in relation to the identified PRA area.
-     Stage 2 (risk assessment) begins with the categorization of individual pests to determine whether
      the criteria for a quarantine pest are satisfied. Risk assessment continues with an evaluation of the
      probability of pest entry, establishment, and spread, and of their potential economic consequences
      (including environmental consequences – S1).
-     Stage 3 (risk management) involves identifying management options for reducing the risks
      identified at Stage 2. These are evaluated for efficacy, feasibility and impact in order to select
      those that are appropriate.

      ISPM 11                                                                 Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



     PEST RISK ANALYSIS FOR QUARANTINE PESTS

     1.    Stage 1: Initiation
     The aim of the initiation stage is to identify the pest(s) and pathways which are of quarantine concern
     and should be considered for risk analysis in relation to the identified PRA area.
S2 Some LMOs may present a phytosanitary risk and therefore warrant a PRA. However other LMOs will
   not present phytosanitary risks beyond those posed by related non-LMOs and therefore will not warrant
   a complete PRA. Thus, for LMOs, the aim of the initiation stage is to identify those LMOs that have the
   characteristics of a potential pest and need to be assessed further, and those which need no further
   assessment under ISPM 11.
S2 LMOs are organisms that have been modified using techniques of modern biotechnology to express one
   or more new or altered traits. In most cases, the parent organism is not normally considered to be a plant
   pest but an assessment may need to be performed to determine if the genetic modification (i.e. gene,
   new gene sequence that regulates other genes, or gene product) results in a new trait or characteristic
   that may present a plant pest risk.
S2 A plant pest risk from LMOs may be presented by:
   -     the organism(s) with the inserted gene(s) (i.e. the LMO)
   -     the combination of genetic material (e.g. gene from plant pests such as viruses) or
   -     the consequences of the genetic material moving to another organism.

     1.1   Initiation points
     The PRA process may be initiated as a result of:
     -    the identification of a pathway that presents a potential pest hazard
     -    the identification of a pest that may require phytosanitary measures
     -    the review or revision of phytosanitary policies and priorities.
S1 The initiation points frequently refer to “pests”. The IPPC defines a pest as “any species, strain or
   biotype of plant, animal, or pathogenic agent, injurious to plants or plant products”. When applying
   these initiation points to the specific case of plants as pests, it is important to note that the plants
   concerned should satisfy this definition. Pests directly affecting plants satisfy this definition. In addition,
   many organisms indirectly affecting plants also satisfy this definition (such as plants as pests, e.g. weeds,
   invasive alien plants). The fact that they are injurious to plants may be based on evidence of their impact
   obtained in an area in which they occur. In the case where there is insufficient evidence that they affect
   plants indirectly, it may nevertheless be appropriate to assess – on the basis of available pertinent
   information – whether they are potentially injurious in the PRA area by using a clearly documented,
   consistently applied and transparent system. This is particularly important for plant species or cultivars
   that are imported for planting.
S2 The types of LMOs that a national plant protection organization (NPPO) may be asked to assess for
   phytosanitary risk include:
     -     plants for use (a) as agricultural crops, for food and feed, ornamental plants or managed forests;
           (b) in bioremediation (as an organism that cleans up pollution); (c) for industrial purposes (e.g.
           production of enzymes or bioplastics); (d) as therapeutic agents (e.g. pharmaceutical production)
     -     biological control agents modified to improve their performance in that role
     -     pests modified to alter their pathogenic characteristic and thereby make them useful for biological
           control (see ISPM 3 (Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and release of biological control
           agents and other beneficial organisms))
     -     organisms genetically modified to improve their characteristics such as for biofertilizer or other
           influences on soil, bioremediation or industrial uses.

S2 In order to be categorized as a pest, an LMO has to be injurious or potentially injurious to plants or plant
   products under conditions in the PRA area. This damage may be in the form of direct effects on plants
   or plant products, or indirect effects. For guidance on the process of determining whether an LMO has
   the potential to be a pest, refer to Annex 3, “Determining the potential for a living modified organism
   to be a pest”.

    1.1.1 PRA initiated by the identification of a pathway
    The need for a new or revised PRA of a specific pathway may arise in the following situations:
    -     International trade is initiated in a commodity not previously imported into the country (usually
          a plant or plant product, including genetically altered plants) or a commodity from a new area or
          new country of origin.
    -     New plant species are imported for selection and scientific research purposes.
    -     A pathway other than commodity import is identified (natural spread, packing material, mail,
          garbage, passenger baggage etc.).
    A list of pests likely to be associated with the pathway (e.g. carried by the commodity) may be generated
    by any combination of official sources, databases, scientific and other literature, or expert consultation.
    It is preferable to prioritize the listing, based on expert judgement on pest distribution and types of pests.
    If no potential quarantine pests are identified as likely to follow the pathway, the PRA may stop at this
    point.
S2 The phrase “genetically altered plants” is understood to mean plants obtained through the use of modern
   biotechnology.

    1.1.2 PRA initiated by the identification of a pest
    A requirement for a new or revised PRA on a specific pest may arise in the following situations:
    -     An emergency arises on discovery of an established infestation or an outbreak of a new pest within
          a PRA area.
    -     An emergency arises on interception of a new pest on an imported commodity.
    -     A new pest risk is identified by scientific research.
    -     A pest is introduced into an area.
    -     A pest is reported to be more damaging in an area other than in its area of origin.
    -     A pest is repeatedly intercepted.
    -     A request is made to import an organism.
    -     An organism is identified as a vector for other pests.
    -     An organism is genetically altered in a way which clearly identifies its potential as a plant pest.
S2 The phrase “genetically altered” is understood to include obtained through the use of modern
   biotechnology.

    1.1.3 PRA initiated by the review or revision of a policy
    A requirement for a new or revised PRA originating from policy concerns will most frequently arise in
    the following situations:
    -      A national decision is taken to review phytosanitary regulations, requirements or operations.
    -      A proposal made by another country or by an international organization (regional plant protection
           organization, FAO) is reviewed.
    -      A new treatment or loss of a treatment system, a new process, or new information impacts on an
           earlier decision.
    -      A dispute arises on phytosanitary measures.



    International Plant Protection Convention                                                          ISPM 11-9
     ISPM 11                                                                    Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    -      The phytosanitary situation in a country changes, a new country is created, or political boundaries
           have changed.

    1.2    Identification of PRA area
    The PRA area should be defined as precisely as possible in order to identify the area for which
    information is needed.

    1.3    Information
    Information gathering is an essential element of all stages of PRA. It is important at the initiation stage
    in order to clarify the identity of the pest(s), its/their present distribution and association with host plants,
    commodities etc. Other information will be gathered as required to reach necessary decisions as the PRA
    continues.
    Information for PRA may come from a variety of sources. The provision of official information
    regarding pest status is an obligation under the IPPC (Article VIII.1(c)) facilitated by official contact
    points (Article VIII.2).
S1 For environmental risks, the variety of sources of information will generally be wider than traditionally
   used by NPPOs. Broader inputs may be required. These sources may include environmental impact
   assessments, but it should be recognized that such assessments usually do not have the same purpose as
   PRA and cannot substitute for PRA.
S2 For LMOs, information required for a full risk analysis may include:
   -    name, identity and taxonomic status of the LMO (including any relevant identifying codes) and
        the risk management measures applied to the LMO in the country of export
   -    taxonomic status, common name, point of collection or acquisition, and characteristics of the
        donor organism
   -    description of the nucleic acid or the modification introduced (including genetic construct) and
        the resulting genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the LMO
   -    details of the transformation process
   -    appropriate detection and identification methods and their specificity, sensitivity and reliability
   -    intended use including intended containment
   -    quantity or volume of the LMO to be imported.
S2 Information regarding pest status is an obligation under the IPPC (Article VIII.1(c)) facilitated by
   official contact points (Article VIII.2). A country may have obligations to provide information about
   LMOs under other international agreements such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the
   Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 2000). The Cartagena Protocol has a Biosafety Clearing-
   house that may contain relevant information. Information on LMOs is sometimes commercially
   sensitive and applicable obligations with regard to release and handling of information should be
   observed.

    1.3.1 Previous PRA
    A check should also be made as to whether pathways, pests or policies have already been subjected to
    the PRA process, either nationally or internationally. If a PRA exists, its validity should be checked as
    circumstances and information may have changed. The possibility of using a PRA from a similar
    pathway or pest, that may partly or entirely replace the need for a new PRA, should also be investigated.

    1.4    Conclusion of initiation
    At the end of Stage 1, the initiation point, the pests and pathways of concern and the PRA area will have
    been identified. Relevant information has been collected and pests have been identified as possible
    candidates for phytosanitary measures, either individually or in association with a pathway.


    ISPM 11-10                                                          International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                          ISPM 11



S2 For LMOs at the end of Stage 1 an NPPO may decide that the LMO:
   -    is a potential pest and needs to be assessed further in Stage 2 or
   -    is not a potential pest and needs no further analysis under ISPM 11 (but see also the following
        paragraph).
S2 PRA under the IPPC only relates to the assessment and management of phytosanitary risks. As with
   other organisms or pathways assessed by an NPPO, LMOs may present other risks not falling within
   the scope covered by the IPPC. For LMOs, PRA may constitute only a portion of the required overall
   risk analysis. For example, countries may require the assessment of risks to human or animal health or
   to the environment beyond that covered by the IPPC. When an NPPO discovers potential for risks that
   are not phytosanitary it may be appropriate to notify the relevant authorities.

    2.     Stage 2: Pest Risk Assessment
    The process for pest risk assessment can be broadly divided into three interrelated steps:
    -     pest categorization
    -     assessment of the probability of introduction and spread
    -     assessment of potential economic consequences (including environmental impacts).
    In most cases, these steps will be applied sequentially in a PRA but it is not essential to follow a
    particular sequence. Pest risk assessment needs to be only as complex as is technically justified by the
    circumstances. This standard allows a specific PRA to be judged against the principles of necessity,
    minimal impact, transparency, equivalence, pest risk analysis, managed risk and non-discrimination set
    out in ISPM 1 (Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the application of phytosanitary
    measures in international trade).
S2 For LMOs, from this point forward in PRA, it is assumed that the LMO is being assessed as a pest, and
   therefore “LMO” refers to an LMO that is a potential quarantine pest due to new or altered characteristics
   or properties resulting from the genetic modification. The risk assessment should be carried out on a
   case-by-case basis. LMOs that have pest characteristics unrelated to the genetic modification should be
   assessed using the normal procedures.

    2.1    Pest categorization
    At the outset, it may not be clear which pest(s) identified in Stage 1 require a PRA. The categorization
    process examines for each pest whether the criteria in the definition for a quarantine pest are satisfied.
    In the evaluation of a pathway associated with a commodity, a number of individual PRAs may be
    necessary for the various pests potentially associated with the pathway. The opportunity to eliminate an
    organism or organisms from consideration before in-depth examination is undertaken is a valuable
    characteristic of the categorization process.
    An advantage of pest categorization is that it can be done with relatively little information; however
    information should be sufficient to adequately carry out the categorization.

    2.1.1 Elements of categorization
    The categorization of a pest as a quarantine pest includes the following primary elements:
    -     identity of the pest
    -     presence or absence in the PRA area
    -     regulatory status
    -     potential for establishment and spread in PRA area
    -     potential for economic consequences (including environmental consequences) in the PRA area.




    International Plant Protection Convention                                                     ISPM 11-11
     ISPM 11                                                                Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    2.1.1.1 Identity of pest
    The identity of the pest should be clearly defined to ensure that the assessment is being performed on a
    distinct organism, and that biological and other information used in the assessment is relevant to the
    organism in question. If this is not possible because the causal agent of particular symptoms has not yet
    been fully identified, then it should have been shown to produce consistent symptoms and to be
    transmissible.
    The taxonomic unit for the pest is generally species. The use of a higher or lower taxonomic level should
    be supported by scientifically sound rationale. In the case of levels below the species, this should include
    evidence demonstrating that factors such as differences in virulence, host range or vector relationships
    are significant enough to affect pest risk.
    Specific guidance on the consideration of identity of plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.
    In cases where a vector is involved, the vector may also be considered a pest to the extent that it is
    associated with the causal organism and is required for transmission of the pest.
S2 In the case of LMOs, identification requires information regarding characteristics of the recipient or
   parent organism, the donor organism, the genetic construct, the gene or transgene vector and the nature
   of the genetic modification. Information requirements are set out under section 1.3.

    2.1.1.2 Presence or absence in PRA area
    The pest should be absent from all or a defined part of the PRA area.
    Specific guidance on determining the presence or absence of plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.
S2 In the case of LMOs, this should relate to the LMO of phytosanitary concern.

    2.1.1.3 Regulatory status
    If the pest is present but not widely distributed in the PRA area, it should be under official control or
    expected to be under official control in the near future.
S1 Official control of pests presenting an environmental risk may involve agencies other than the NPPO.
   However, it is recognized that ISPM 5 Supplement 1 (Guidelines on the interpretation and application
   of the concepts of “official control” and “not widely distributed”) applies, in particular its provisions
   regarding NPPO authority and involvement in official control.
S2 In the case of LMOs, official control should relate to the phytosanitary measures applied because of the
   pest nature of the LMO. It may be appropriate to consider any official control measures in place for the
   parent organism, donor organism, transgene vector or gene vector.

    2.1.1.4 Potential for establishment and spread in PRA area
    Evidence should be available to support the conclusion that the pest could become established or spread
    in the PRA area. The PRA area should have ecological/climatic conditions including those in protected
    conditions suitable for the establishment and spread of the pest and where relevant, host species (or near
    relatives), alternate hosts and vectors should be present in the PRA area.
S2 For LMOs, the following should also be considered:
   -    changes in adaptive characteristics resulting from the genetic modification that may increase the
        potential for establishment and spread
   -    gene transfer or gene flow that may result in the establishment and spread of pests, or the
        emergence of new pests
   -    genotypic and phenotypic instability that could result in the establishment and spread of
        organisms with new pest characteristics, e.g. loss of sterility genes designed to prevent
        outcrossing.

    ISPM 11-12                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                                   ISPM 11



S2 For more detailed guidance on the assessment of these characteristics, see Annex 3.

    2.1.1.5 Potential for economic consequences in PRA area
    There should be clear indications that the pest is likely to have an unacceptable economic impact
    (including environmental impact) in the PRA area.
S1 Unacceptable economic impact is described in ISPM 5 Supplement 2 (Guidelines on the understanding
   of potential economic importance and related terms including reference to environmental
   considerations).
S2 In the case of LMOs, the economic impact (including environmental impact) should relate to the pest
   nature (injurious to plants and plant products) of the LMO.

    2.1.2 Conclusion of pest categorization
    If it has been determined that the pest has the potential to be a quarantine pest, the PRA process should
    continue. If a pest does not fulfil all of the criteria for a quarantine pest, the PRA process for that pest
    may stop. In the absence of sufficient information, the uncertainties should be identified and the PRA
    process should continue.

    2.2    Assessment of the probability of introduction and spread
    Pest introduction is comprised of both entry and establishment. Assessing the probability of introduction
    requires an analysis of each of the pathways with which a pest may be associated from its origin to its
    establishment in the PRA area. In a PRA initiated by a specific pathway (usually an imported
    commodity), the probability of pest entry is evaluated for the pathway in question. The probabilities for
    pest entry associated with other pathways need to be investigated as well.
    For risk analyses that have been initiated for a specific pest, with no particular commodity or pathway
    under consideration, the potential of all probable pathways should be considered.
    The assessment of probability of spread is based primarily on biological considerations similar to those
    for entry and establishment.
S1 With respect to a plant being assessed as a pest with indirect effects, wherever a reference is made to a
   “host” or “host range”, these terms should be understood to refer to a suitable habitat1 in the PRA area.
S1 In the case of plants as pests, the concepts of entry, establishment and spread may have to be considered
   differently.
S1 For plants for planting proposed for import, the probability of entry need not be assessed. Following
   import, the plants may be planted and maintained in a particular location. The pest risk may arise if there
   is a possibility that the plants may spread from the location where they are intended to grow and establish
   in the endangered area. Accordingly, section 2.2.3 may be considered before section 2.2.2.
S1 Imported plants not intended to be planted may be used for various purposes (e.g. as bird seed, as fodder,
   or for processing). The pest risk of such plants may arise if there is a possibility that the plants may
   escape or be diverted from the intended use and establish in the endangered area.
    Specific guidance on the consideration of habitats, locations and endangered area for plants as pests is
    provided in Annex 4.
S2 Assessing the probability of introduction of an LMO requires an analysis of both intentional or
   unintentional pathways of introduction, and intended use.


    1
     In the case of organisms that affect plants indirectly, through effects on other organisms, the terms host/habitat
    will extend also to those other organisms.

    International Plant Protection Convention                                                              ISPM 11-13
     ISPM 11                                                                Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    2.2.1 Probability of entry of a pest
    The probability of entry of a pest depends on the pathways from the exporting country to the destination,
    and the frequency and quantity of pests associated with them. The higher the number of pathways, the
    greater the probability of the pest entering the PRA area.
    Documented pathways for the pest to enter new areas should be noted. Potential pathways, which may
    not currently exist, should be assessed. Pest interception data may provide evidence of the ability of a
    pest to be associated with a pathway and to survive in transport or storage.
S1 The probability of entry need not be assessed for plants that are proposed for import. However, the
   probability of entry needs to be assessed for pests that may be carried by such plants (e.g. contaminating
   seeds carried with seeds imported for planting).
    Specific guidance on assessing the probability of entry for plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.

S2 This section is not relevant to LMOs imported for intentional release into the environment.

    2.2.1.1 Identification of pathways for a PRA initiated by a pest
    All relevant pathways should be considered. They can be identified principally in relation to the
    geographical distribution and host range of the pest. Consignments of plants and plant products moving
    in international trade are the principal pathways of concern and existing patterns of such trade will, to a
    substantial extent, determine which pathways are relevant. Other pathways such as other types of
    commodities, packing materials, persons, baggage, mail, conveyances and the exchange of scientific
    material should be considered where appropriate. Entry by natural means should also be assessed, as
    natural spread is likely to reduce the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures.
S2 For LMOs, all relevant pathways of introduction should be considered (intentional and unintentional).

    2.2.1.2 Probability of the pest being associated with the pathway at origin
    The probability of the pest being associated, spatially or temporally, with the pathway at origin should
    be estimated. Factors to consider are:
    -      prevalence of the pest in the source area
    -      occurrence of the pest in a life stage that would be associated with commodities, containers, or
           conveyances
    -      volume and frequency of movement along the pathway
    -      seasonal timing
    -      pest management, cultural and commercial procedures applied at the place of origin (application
           of plant protection products, handling, culling, roguing, grading).

    2.2.1.3 Probability of survival during transport or storage
    Examples of factors to consider are:
    -    speed and conditions of transport and duration of the life cycle of the pest in relation to time in
         transport and storage
    -    vulnerability of the life stages during transport or storage
    -    prevalence of pest likely to be associated with a consignment
    -    commercial procedures (e.g. refrigeration) applied to consignments in the country of origin,
         country of destination, or in transport or storage.

    2.2.1.4 Probability of pest surviving existing pest management procedures
    Existing pest management procedures (including phytosanitary procedures) applied to consignments
    against other pests from origin to end use, should be evaluated for effectiveness against the pest in


    ISPM 11-14                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                             ISPM 11



    question. The probability that the pest will go undetected during inspection or survive other existing
    phytosanitary procedures should be estimated.

    2.2.1.5 Probability of transfer to a suitable host
    Factors to consider are:
    -     dispersal mechanisms, including vectors to allow movement from the pathway to a suitable host
    -     whether the imported commodity is to be sent to a few or many destination points in the PRA
          area
    -     proximity of entry, transit and destination points to suitable hosts
    -     time of year at which import takes place
    -     intended use of the commodity (e.g. for planting, processing and consumption)
    -     risks from by-products and waste.
    Some uses are associated with a much higher probability of introduction (e.g. planting) than others (e.g.
    processing). The probability associated with any growth, processing, or disposal of the commodity in
    the vicinity of suitable hosts should also be considered.
S2 For LMOs, the probability of gene flow and gene transfer should also be considered, when there is a
   trait of phytosanitary concern that may be transferred.

    2.2.2 Probability of establishment
    In order to estimate the probability of establishment of a pest, reliable biological information (life cycle,
    host range, epidemiology, survival etc.) should be obtained from the areas where the pest currently
    occurs. The situation in the PRA area can then be compared with that in the areas where it currently
    occurs (taking account also of protected environments such as glass- or greenhouses) and expert
    judgement used to assess the probability of establishment. Case histories concerning comparable pests
    can be considered. Examples of the factors to consider are:
    -     availability, quantity and distribution of hosts in the PRA area
    -     environmental suitability in the PRA area
    -     potential for adaptation of the pest
    -     reproductive strategy of the pest
    -     method of pest survival
    -     cultural practices and control measures.
    In considering probability of establishment, it should be noted that a transient pest (see ISPM 8
    (Determination of pest status in an area)) may not be able to establish in the PRA area (e.g. because of
    unsuitable climatic conditions) but could still have unacceptable economic consequences (see IPPC
    Article VII.3).
S1 In the case of plants as pests, assessment of the probability of establishment concerns their establishment
   in habitats other than those in which they are intended to grow.
    Specific guidance on assessing the probability of establishment of plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.
S2 For LMOs, the survival capacity without human intervention should also be considered.
S2 In addition, where gene flow is a concern in the PRA area, the probability of expression and
   establishment of a trait of phytosanitary concern should be considered.
S2 Case histories concerning comparable LMOs or other organisms carrying the same construct can be
   considered.




    International Plant Protection Convention                                                        ISPM 11-15
     ISPM 11                                                                  Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    2.2.2.1 Availability of suitable hosts, alternate hosts and vectors in the PRA area
    Factors to consider are:
    -     whether hosts and alternate hosts are present and how abundant or widely distributed they may
          be
    -     whether hosts and alternate hosts occur within sufficient geographic proximity to allow the pest
          to complete its life cycle
    -     whether there are other plant species, which could prove to be suitable hosts in the absence of the
          usual host species
    -     whether a vector, if needed for dispersal of the pest, is already present in the PRA area or likely
          to be introduced
    -     whether another vector species occurs in the PRA area.
    The taxonomic level at which hosts are considered should normally be the “species”. The use of higher
    or lower taxonomic levels should be justified by scientifically sound rationale.

    2.2.2.2 Suitability of environment
    Factors in the environment (e.g. suitability of climate, soil, pest and host competition) that are critical
    to the development of the pest, its host and if applicable its vector, and to their ability to survive periods
    of climatic stress and complete their life cycles, should be identified. It should be noted that the
    environment is likely to have different effects on the pest, its host and its vector. This needs to be
    recognized in determining whether the interaction between these organisms in the area of origin is
    maintained in the PRA area to the benefit or detriment of the pest. The probability of establishment in a
    protected environment, e.g. in glasshouses, should also be considered.
    Climatic modelling systems may be used to compare climatic data on the known distribution of a pest
    with that in the PRA area.

    2.2.2.3 Cultural practices and control measures
    Where applicable, practices employed during the cultivation/production of the host crops should be
    compared to determine if there are differences in such practices between the PRA area and the origin of
    the pest that may influence its ability to establish.
S2 For plants that are LMOs, it may also be appropriate to consider specific cultural, control or management
   practices.
    Pest control programmes or natural enemies already in the PRA area which reduce the probability of
    establishment may be considered. Pests for which control is not feasible should be considered to present
    a greater risk than those for which treatment is easily accomplished. The availability (or lack) of suitable
    methods for eradication should also be considered.

    2.2.2.4 Other characteristics of the pest affecting the probability of establishment
    Other characteristics of the pest affecting the probability of establishment include:
    -     Reproductive strategy of the pests and method of pest survival. Characteristics, which enable the
          pest to reproduce effectively in the new environment, such as parthenogenesis/self-crossing,
          duration of the life cycle, number of generations per year, resting stage etc., should be identified.
    -     Genetic adaptability. Whether the species is polymorphic and the degree to which the pest has
          demonstrated the ability to adapt to conditions like those in the PRA area should be considered,
          e.g., host-specific races or races adapted to a wider range of habitats or to new hosts. This
          genotypic (and phenotypic) variability facilitates a pest’s ability to withstand environmental
          fluctuations, to adapt to a wider range of habitats, to develop pesticide resistance and to overcome
          host resistance.



    ISPM 11-16                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                           ISPM 11



    -      Minimum population needed for establishment. If possible, the threshold population that is
           required for establishment should be estimated.
S2 For LMOs, if there is evidence of genotypic and phenotypic instability, this should be considered.
S2 It may also be appropriate to consider proposed production and control practices related to the LMO in
   the country of import.

    2.2.3 Probability of spread after establishment
    A pest with a high potential for spread may also have a high potential for establishment, and possibilities
    for its successful containment and/or eradication are more limited. In order to estimate the probability
    of spread of the pest, reliable biological information should be obtained from areas where the pest
    currently occurs. The situation in the PRA area can then be carefully compared with that in the areas
    where the pest currently occurs and expert judgement used to assess the probability of spread. Case
    histories concerning comparable pests can usefully be considered. Examples of the factors to consider
    are:
    -       suitability of the natural and/or managed environment for natural spread of the pest
    -       presence of natural barriers
    -       the potential for movement with commodities or conveyances
    -       intended use of the commodity
    -       potential vectors of the pest in the PRA area
    -       potential natural enemies of the pest in the PRA area.
S1 In the case of plants as pests, assessment of spread concerns spread from the location where the plants
   are intended to grow or from the intended use to the endangered area.
    Specific guidance on assessing the probability of spread of plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.
    The information on probability of spread is used to estimate how rapidly a pest’s potential economic
    importance may be expressed within the PRA area. This also has significance if the pest is liable to enter
    and establish in an area of low potential economic importance and then spread to an area of high potential
    economic importance. In addition it may be important in the risk management stage when considering
    the feasibility of containment or eradication of an introduced pest.
S1 Certain pests may not cause injurious effects on plants immediately after they establish, and in particular
   may only spread after a certain time. In assessing the probability of spread, this should be considered,
   based on evidence of such behaviour.

    2.2.4 Conclusion on the probability of introduction and spread
    The overall probability of introduction should be expressed in terms most suitable for the data, the
    methods used for analysis, and the intended audience. This may be quantitative or qualitative, since
    either output is in any case the result of a combination of both quantitative and qualitative information.
    The probability of introduction may be expressed as a comparison with that obtained from PRAs on
    other pests.

    2.2.4.1 Conclusion regarding endangered areas
    The part of the PRA area where ecological factors favour the establishment of the pest should be
    identified in order to define the endangered area. This may be the whole of the PRA area or a part of the
    area.

    2.3    Assessment of potential economic consequences
    Requirements described in this step indicate what information relative to the pest and its potential host
    plants should be assembled, and suggest levels of economic analysis that may be carried out using that


    International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 11-17
     ISPM 11                                                               Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    information in order to assess all the effects of the pest, i.e. the potential economic consequences.
    Wherever appropriate, quantitative data that will provide monetary values should be obtained.
    Qualitative data may also be used. Consultation with an economist may be useful.
    In many instances, detailed analysis of the estimated economic consequences is not necessary if there is
    sufficient evidence or it is widely agreed that the introduction of a pest will have unacceptable economic
    consequences (including environmental consequences). In such cases, risk assessment will primarily
    focus on the probability of introduction and spread. It will, however, be necessary to examine economic
    factors in greater detail when the level of economic consequences is in question, or when the level of
    economic consequences is needed to evaluate the strength of measures used for risk management or in
    assessing the cost-benefit of exclusion or control.
    Specific guidance on assessing the potential economic consequences of plants as pests is provided in
    Annex 4.
S2 In the case of LMOs, the economic impact (including environmental impact) should relate to the pest
   nature (injurious to plants and plant products) of the LMO.
S2 For LMOs, the following evidence should also be considered:
   -    potential economic consequences that could result from adverse effects on non-target organisms
        that are injurious to plants or plant products
   -    economic consequences that could result from pest properties.
S2 For more detailed guidance on the assessment of these characteristics, see Annex 3.

    2.3.1 Pest effects
    In order to estimate the potential economic importance of the pest, information should be obtained from
    areas where the pest occurs naturally or has been introduced. This information should be compared with
    the situation in the PRA area. Case histories concerning comparable pests can usefully be considered.
    The effects considered may be direct or indirect.
S1 The basic method for estimating the potential economic importance of pests in this section also applies
   to:
   -     pests affecting uncultivated/unmanaged plants
   -     plants as pests
   -     pests affecting plants through effects on other organisms.
S1 In the case of direct and indirect environmental effects, specific evidence is needed.
S1 In the case of plants for planting that may be pests, the long-term consequences for the habitat in which
   the plants are intended to grow may be included in the assessment because planting may affect further
   use of or have a harmful effect on that habitat.
S1 Environmental effects and consequences considered should result from effects on plants. Such effects,
   however, on plants may be less significant than the effects and/or consequences on other organisms or
   systems. For example, a plant as a pest that has only a minor impact on plants may be significantly
   allergenic for humans or a minor plant pathogen may produce toxins that seriously affect livestock.
   However, the regulation of plants solely on the basis of their effects on other organisms or systems (e.g.
   on human or animal health) is outside the scope of this standard. If the PRA process reveals evidence of
   a potential hazard to other organisms or systems, this should be communicated to the appropriate
   authorities that have the legal responsibility to deal with the issue.




    ISPM 11-18                                                      International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                             ISPM 11



    2.3.1.1 Direct pest effects
    For identification and characterization of the direct effects of the pest on each potential host in the PRA
    area, or those effects which are host-specific, the following are examples that could be considered:
    -      known or potential host plants (in the field, under protected cultivation, or in the wild)
    -      types, amount and frequency of damage
    -      crop losses, in yield and quality
    -      biotic factors (e.g. adaptability and virulence of the pest) affecting damage and losses
    -      abiotic factors (e.g. climate) affecting damage and losses
    -      rate of spread
    -      rate of reproduction
    -      control measures (including existing measures), their efficacy and cost
    -      effect on existing production practices
    -      environmental effects.
    For each of the potential hosts, the total area of the crop and area potentially endangered should be
    estimated in relation to the elements given above.
S1 In the case of the analysis of environmental risks, examples of direct pest effects on plants and/or their
   environmental consequences that could be considered include:
   -      reduction of keystone plant species
   -      reduction of plant species that are major components of ecosystems (in terms of abundance or
          size), and endangered native plant species (including effects below species level where there is
          evidence of such effects being significant)
   -      significant reduction, displacement or elimination of other plant species.
S1 The estimation of the area potentially endangered should relate to these effects.

    2.3.1.2 Indirect pest effects
    For identification and characterization of the indirect effects of the pest in the PRA area, or those effects
    that are not host-specific, the following are examples that could be considered:
    -      effects on domestic and export markets, including in particular effects on export market access
           (The potential consequences for market access which may result if the pest becomes established,
           should be estimated. This involves considering the extent of any phytosanitary regulations
           imposed (or likely to be imposed) by importing countries.)
    -      changes to producer costs or input demands, including control costs
    -      changes to domestic or foreign consumer demand for a product resulting from quality changes
    -      environmental and other undesired effects of control measures
    -      feasibility and cost of eradication or containment
    -      capacity to act as a vector for other pests
    -      resources needed for additional research and advice
    -      social and other effects (e.g. tourism).
S1 In the case of the analysis of environmental risks, examples of indirect pest effects on plants and/or their
   environmental consequences that could be considered include:
   -      significant effects on plant communities
   -      significant effects on designated environmentally sensitive or protected areas
   -      significant change in ecological processes and the structure, stability or processes of an ecosystem
          (including further effects on plant species, erosion, water table changes, increased fire hazard,
          nutrient cycling)

    International Plant Protection Convention                                                        ISPM 11-19
     ISPM 11                                                                Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    -      effects on human use (e.g. water quality, recreational uses, tourism, animal grazing, hunting,
           fishing)
    -      costs of environmental restoration.
S1 Effects on human and animal health (e.g. toxicity, allergenicity), water tables, tourism etc. could also be
   considered, as appropriate, by other agencies/authorities.

    2.3.2 Analysis of economic consequences
    2.3.2.1 Time and place factors
    Estimations made in the previous section related to a hypothetical situation where the pest is supposed
    to have been introduced and to be fully expressing its potential economic consequences (per year) in the
    PRA area. In practice, however, economic consequences are expressed with time, and may concern one
    year, several years or an indeterminate period. Various scenarios should be considered. The total
    economic consequences over more than one year can be expressed as net present value of annual
    economic consequences, and an appropriate discount rate selected to calculate net present value.
    Other scenarios could concern whether the pest occurs at one, few or many points in the PRA area and
    the expression of potential economic consequences will depend on the rate and manner of spread in the
    PRA area. The rate of spread may be envisaged to be slow or rapid; in some cases, it may be supposed
    that spread can be prevented. Appropriate analysis may be used to estimate potential economic
    consequences over the period of time when a pest is spreading in the PRA area. In addition, many of the
    factors or effects considered above could be expected to change over time, with the consequent effects
    of potential economic consequences. Expert judgement and estimations will be required.

    2.3.2.2 Analysis of commercial consequences
    As determined above, most of the direct effects of a pest, and some of the indirect effects will be of a
    commercial nature, or have consequences for an identified market. These effects, which may be positive
    or negative, should be identified and quantified. The following may usefully be considered:
    -     effect of pest-induced changes to producer profits that result from changes in production costs,
          yields or prices
    -     effect of pest-induced changes in quantities demanded or prices paid for commodities by domestic
          and international consumers. This could include quality changes in products and/or quarantine-
          related trade restrictions resulting from a pest introduction.

    2.3.2.3 Analytical techniques
    There are analytical techniques which can be used in consultation with experts in economics to make a
    more detailed analysis of the potential economic effects of a quarantine pest. These should incorporate
    all of the effects that have been identified. These techniques may include:
    -       Partial budgeting. This will be adequate, if the economic effects induced by the action of the pest
            to producer profits are generally limited to producers and are considered to be relatively minor.
    -       Partial equilibrium. This is recommended if, under point 2.3.2.2, there is a significant change in
            producer profits, or if there is a significant change in consumer demand. Partial equilibrium
            analysis is necessary to measure welfare changes, or the net changes arising from the pest impacts
            on producers and consumers.
    -       General equilibrium. If the economic changes are significant to a national economy, and could
            cause changes to factors such as wages, interest rates or exchange rates, then general equilibrium
            analysis could be used to establish the full range of economic effects.
    The use of analytical techniques is often limited by lack of data, by uncertainties in the data, and by the
    fact that for certain effects only qualitative information can be provided.




    ISPM 11-20                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                           ISPM 11



    2.3.2.4 Non-commercial and environmental consequences
    Some of the direct and indirect effects of the introduction of a pest determined in sections 2.3.1.1 and
    2.3.1.2 will be of an economic nature, or affect some type of value, but not have an existing market
    which can be easily identified. As a result, the effects may not be adequately measured in terms of prices
    in established product or service markets. Examples include in particular environmental effects (such as
    ecosystem stability, biodiversity, amenity value) and social effects (such as employment, tourism)
    arising from a pest introduction. These impacts could be approximated with an appropriate non-market
    valuation method. More details on environment are given below.
    If quantitative measurement of such consequences is not feasible, qualitative information about the
    consequences may be provided. An explanation of how this information has been incorporated into
    decisions should also be provided.
S1 Application of this standard to environmental hazards requires clear categorization of environmental
   values and how they can be assessed. The environment can be valued using different methodologies,
   but these methodologies are best used in consultation with experts in economics. Methodologies may
   include consideration of “use” and “non-use” values. “Use” values arise from consumption of an
   element of the environment, such as accessing clean water, or fishing in a lake, and also those that are
   non-consumptive, such as use of forests for leisure activities. “Non-use” values may be subdivided into:
   -     “option value” (value for use at a later date)
   -     “existence value” (knowledge that an element of the environment exists)
   -     “bequest value” (knowledge that an element of the environment is available for future
         generations).
S1 Whether the element of the environment is being assessed in terms of use or non-use values, methods
   exist for their valuation, such as market-based approaches, surrogate markets, simulated markets, and
   benefit transfer. Each has advantages, disadvantages and situations where it is particularly useful.
S1 The assessment of consequences may be either quantitative or qualitative and in many cases, qualitative
   data is sufficient. A quantitative method may not exist to address a situation (e.g. catastrophic effects on
   a keystone species), or a quantitative analysis may not be possible (no methods available). Useful
   analyses can be based on non-monetary valuations (number of species affected, water quality), or expert
   judgement, if the analyses follow documented, consistent and transparent procedures.
S1 Economic impact is described in ISPM 5 Supplement 2.

    2.3.3 Conclusion of the assessment of economic consequences
    Wherever appropriate, the output of the assessment of economic consequences described in this step
    should be in terms of a monetary value. The economic consequences can also be expressed qualitatively
    or using quantitative measures without monetary terms. Sources of information, assumptions and
    methods of analysis should be clearly specified.

    2.3.3.1 Endangered area
    The part of the PRA area where presence of the pest will result in economically important loss should
    be identified as appropriate. This is needed to define the endangered area.

    2.4    Degree of uncertainty
    Estimation of the probability of introduction of a pest and of its economic consequences involves many
    uncertainties. In particular, this estimation is an extrapolation from the situation where the pest occurs
    to the hypothetical situation in the PRA area. It is important to document the areas of uncertainty and
    the degree of uncertainty in the assessment, and to indicate where expert judgement has been used. This
    is necessary for transparency and may also be useful for identifying and prioritizing research needs.



    International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 11-21
     ISPM 11                                                                Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



S1 It should be noted that the assessment of the probability and consequences of environmental hazards of
   pests of uncultivated and unmanaged plants often involves greater uncertainty than for pests of cultivated
   or managed plants. This is due to the lack of information, additional complexity associated with
   ecosystems, and variability associated with pests, hosts or habitats.

    2.5    Conclusion of the pest risk assessment stage
    As a result of the pest risk assessment, all or some of the categorized pests may be considered appropriate
    for pest risk management. For each pest, all or part of the PRA area may be identified as an endangered
    area. A quantitative or qualitative estimate of the probability of introduction of a pest or pests, and a
    corresponding quantitative or qualitative estimate of economic consequences (including environmental
    consequences), have been obtained and documented or an overall rating could have been assigned. These
    estimates, with associated uncertainties, are utilized in the pest risk management stage of the PRA.

    3.     Stage 3: Pest Risk Management
    The conclusions from pest risk assessment are used to decide whether risk management is required and
    the strength of measures to be used. Since zero-risk is not a reasonable option, the guiding principle for
    risk management should be to manage risk to achieve the required degree of safety that can be justified
    and is feasible within the limits of available options and resources. Pest risk management (in the
    analytical sense) is the process of identifying ways to react to a perceived risk, evaluating the efficacy
    of these actions, and identifying the most appropriate options. The uncertainty noted in the assessments
    of economic consequences and probability of introduction should also be considered and included in the
    selection of a pest management option.
S1 In considering the management of environmental risks, it should be stressed that phytosanitary measures
   are intended to account for uncertainty and should be designed in proportion to the risk. Pest risk
   management options should be identified, taking account of the degree of uncertainty in the assessment
   of economic consequences, probability of introduction, and the respective technical justification of those
   options. In this respect, the management of risks to the environment caused by plant pests does not differ
   from the management of other plant pest risks.
    Specific guidance on pest risk management for plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.

    3.1    Level of risk
    In implementing the principle of managed risk (ISPM 1), countries should decide what level of risk is
    acceptable to them.
    The acceptable level of risk may be expressed in a number of ways, such as:
    -     reference to existing phytosanitary requirements
    -     indexed to estimated economic losses
    -     expressed on a scale of risk tolerance
    -     compared with the level of risk accepted by other countries.
S2 For LMOs, the acceptable level of risk may also be expressed by comparison to the level of risk
   associated with similar or related organisms, based on their characteristics and behaviour in a similar
   environment to the PRA area.

    3.2    Technical information required
    The decisions to be made in the pest risk management process will be based on the information collected
    during the preceding stages of PRA. This information will be composed of:
    -     reasons for initiating the process
    -     estimation of the probability of introduction to the PRA area
    -     evaluation of potential economic consequences in the PRA area.


    ISPM 11-22                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                          ISPM 11



    3.3    Acceptability of risk
    Overall risk is determined by the examination of the outputs of the assessments of the probability of
    introduction and the economic impact. If the risk is found to be unacceptable, then the first step in risk
    management is to identify possible phytosanitary measures that will reduce the risk to, or below an
    acceptable level. Measures are not justified if the risk is already acceptable or must be accepted because
    it is not manageable (as may be the case with natural spread). Countries may decide that a low level of
    monitoring or audit is maintained to ensure that future changes in the pest risk are identified.

    3.4    Identification and selection of appropriate risk management options
    Appropriate measures should be chosen based on their effectiveness in reducing the probability of
    introduction of the pest. The choice should be based on the following considerations, which include
    several of the phytosanitary principles of ISPM 1:
    -     Phytosanitary measures shown to be cost-effective and feasible. The benefit from the use of
          phytosanitary measures is that the pest will not be introduced and the PRA area will, consequently,
          not be subjected to the potential economic consequences. The cost-benefit analysis for each of
          the minimum measures found to provide acceptable security may be estimated. Those measures
          with an acceptable benefit-to-cost ratio should be considered.
    -     Principle of “minimal impact”. Measures should not be more trade restrictive than necessary.
          Measures should be applied to the minimum area necessary for the effective protection of the
          endangered area.
    -     Reassessment of previous requirements. No additional measures should be imposed if existing
          measures are effective.
    -     Principle of “equivalence”. If different phytosanitary measures with the same effect are
          identified, they should be accepted as alternatives.
    -     Principle of “non-discrimination”. If the pest under consideration is established in the PRA area
          but of limited distribution and under official control, the phytosanitary measures in relation to
          import should not be more stringent than those applied within the PRA area. Likewise,
          phytosanitary measures should not discriminate between exporting countries where the status of
          the relevant pest is the same.
S1 The principle of non-discrimination and the concept of official control also apply to:
   -     pests affecting uncultivated/unmanaged plants
   -     plants as pests
   -     pests affecting plants through effects on other organisms.
S1 If any of these become established in the PRA area and if official control is applied, then phytosanitary
   measures at import should not be more stringent than the official control measures.
    The major risk of introduction of plant pests is with imported consignments of plants and plant products,
    but (especially for a PRA performed on a particular pest) it is necessary to consider the risk of
    introduction with other types of pathways (e.g. packing materials, conveyances, travellers and their
    luggage, and the natural spread of a pest).
    The measures listed below are examples of those that are most commonly applied to traded commodities.
    They are applied to pathways, usually consignments of a host, from a specific origin. The measures
    should be as precise as possible as to consignment type (hosts, parts of plants) and origin so as not to
    act as barriers to trade by limiting the import of products where this is not justified. Combinations of
    two or more measures may be needed in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The available
    measures can be classified into broad categories which relate to the pest status of the pathway in the
    country of origin. These include measures:
    -      applied to the consignment
    -      applied to prevent or reduce original infestation in the crop

    International Plant Protection Convention                                                     ISPM 11-23
     ISPM 11                                                                  Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    -      to ensure the area or place of production is free from the pest
    -      concerning the prohibition of commodities.
    Other options may arise in the PRA area (restrictions on the use of a commodity), control measures,
    introduction of a biological control agent, eradication and containment. Such options should also be
    evaluated and will apply in particular if the pest is already present but not widely distributed in the PRA
    area.

    3.4.1 Options for consignments
    Measures may include any combinations of the following:
    -    inspection or testing for freedom from a pest or to a specified pest tolerance – sample size should
         be adequate to give an acceptable probability of detecting the pest
    -    prohibition of parts of the host
    -    a pre-entry or post-entry quarantine system – this system could be considered to be the most
         intensive form of inspection or testing where suitable facilities and resources are available, and
         may be the only option for certain pests not detectable on entry
    -    specified conditions of preparation of the consignment (e.g. handling to prevent infestation or
         reinfestation)
    -    specified treatment of the consignment – such treatments are applied post-harvest and could
         include chemical, thermal, irradiation or other physical methods
    -    restrictions on end use, distribution and periods of entry of the commodity.
    Measures may also be applied to restrict the import of consignments of pests.
S1 The concept of consignments of pests may be applied to the import of plants considered to be pests.
   These consignments may be restricted to species or varieties posing less risk.
S2 For LMOs, as for other organisms, information may have been obtained concerning the risk management
   measures applied to the LMO in the country of export (see section 1.3). These should be assessed to
   determine if they are appropriate for the conditions in the PRA area and, if appropriate, the intended
   use.
S2 For LMOs, measures may also include procedures for the provision of information on the phytosanitary
   integrity of consignments (e.g. tracing systems, documentation systems, identity preservation systems).

    3.4.2 Options preventing or reducing infestation in the crop
    Measures may include:
    -    treatment of the crop, field, or place of production
    -    restriction of the composition of a consignment so that it is composed of plants belonging to
         resistant or less susceptible species
    -    growing plants under specially protected conditions (glasshouse, isolation)
    -    harvesting of plants at a certain age or a specified time of year
    -    production in a certification scheme. An officially monitored plant production scheme usually
         involves a number of carefully controlled generations, beginning with nuclear stock plants of high
         health status. It may be specified that the plants be derived from plants within a limited number
         of generations.
S2 Measures may be applied to reduce the probability that LMOs (or genetic material from LMOs) that
   pose a phytosanitary risk could be in other crops. These include:
   -     management systems (e.g. buffer zones, refugia)
   -     management of trait expression
   -     control of reproductive ability (e.g. male sterility)


    ISPM 11-24                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests                                                           ISPM 11



    -      control of alternative hosts.
    3.4.3 Options ensuring that the area, place or site of production or crop is free from the
          pest
    Measures may include:
    -    pest-free area – requirements for pest-free area status are described in ISPM 4 (Requirements for
         the establishment of pest free areas)
    -    pest-free place of production or pest-free production site – requirements are described in ISPM 10
         (Requirements for the establishment of pest free places of production and pest free production
         sites)
    -    inspection of crop to confirm pest freedom.

    3.4.4 Options for other types of pathways
    For many types of pathways, the measures considered above for plants and plant products to detect the
    pest in the consignment or to prevent infestation of the consignment, may also be used or adapted. For
    certain types of pathways, the following factors should be considered:
    -      Natural spread of a pest includes movement of the pest by flight, wind dispersal, transport by
           vectors such as insects or birds and natural migration. If the pest is entering the PRA area by
           natural spread, or is likely to enter in the immediate future, phytosanitary measures may have
           little effect. Control measures applied in the area of origin could be considered. Similarly,
           containment or eradication, supported by suppression and surveillance, in the PRA area after entry
           of the pest could be considered.
    -      Measures for human travellers and their baggage could include targeted inspections, publicity and
           fines or incentives. In a few cases, treatments may be possible.
    -      Contaminated machinery or modes of transport (ships, trains, planes, road transport) could be
           subjected to cleaning or disinfestation.

    3.4.5 Options within the importing country
    Certain measures applied within the importing country may also be used. These could include careful
    surveillance to try and detect the entry of the pest as early as possible, eradication programmes to
    eliminate any foci of infestation and/or containment action to limit spread.
S1 For plants to be imported, where there is a high level of uncertainty regarding pest risk, it may be decided
   not to take phytosanitary measures at import, but only to apply surveillance or other procedures after
   entry (e.g. by or under the supervision of the NPPO).
S2 The potential for risk from LMO pests depends in part on the intended use. As for other organisms,
   certain intended uses (such as high security contained use) may significantly manage risk.
S2 For LMOs, as with other pests, options within the country also include the use of emergency measures
   related to phytosanitary risks. Any emergency measures should be consistent with Article VII.6 of the
   IPPC.

    3.4.6 Prohibition of commodities
    If no satisfactory measure to reduce risk to an acceptable level can be found, the final option may be to
    prohibit importation of the relevant commodities. This should be viewed as a measure of last resort and
    should be considered in light of the anticipated efficacy, especially in instances where the incentives for
    illegal import may be significant.

    3.5    Phytosanitary certificates and other compliance measures
    Risk management includes the consideration of appropriate compliance procedures. The most important
    of these is export certification (see ISPM 7 (Phytosanitary certification system)). The issuance of


    International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 11-25
     ISPM 11                                                               Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests



    phytosanitary certificates (see ISPM 12 (Phytosanitary certificates)) provides official assurance that a
    consignment is “considered to be free from the quarantine pests specified by the importing contracting
    party and to conform with the current phytosanitary requirements of the importing contracting party.” It
    thus confirms that the specified risk management options have been followed. An additional declaration
    may be required to indicate that a particular measure has been carried out. Other compliance measures
    may be used subject to bilateral or multilateral agreement.
S2 Information on phytosanitary certificates regarding LMOs (as with any other regulated articles) should
   only be related to phytosanitary measures (see ISPM 12).

    3.6    Conclusion of pest risk management
    The result of the pest risk management procedure will be either that no measures are identified which
    are considered appropriate or the selection of one or more management options that have been found to
    lower the risk associated with the pest(s) to an acceptable level. These management options form the
    basis of phytosanitary regulations or requirements.
    The application and maintenance of such regulations is subject to certain obligations in the case of
    contracting parties to the IPPC.
S1 Phytosanitary measures taken in relation to environmental hazards should, as appropriate, be notified to
   relevant competent authorities responsible for national biodiversity policies, strategies and action plans.
S1 It is noted that the communication of risks associated with environmental hazards is of particular
   importance to promote awareness.
    Specific guidance on risk communication for plants as pests is provided in Annex 4.

    3.6.1 Monitoring and review of phytosanitary measures
    In accordance with the principle of modification (ISPM 1) the implementation of particular
    phytosanitary measures should not be considered to be permanent. After application, the success of the
    measures in achieving their aim should be determined by monitoring during use. This is often achieved
    by inspection of the commodity on arrival, noting any interceptions or any entries of the pest to the PRA
    area. The information supporting the pest risk analysis should be periodically reviewed to ensure that
    any new information that becomes available does not invalidate the decision taken.

    4.     Documentation of Pest Risk Analysis
    4.1    Documentation requirements
    The IPPC and the principle of transparency (ISPM 1) require that countries should, on request, make
    available the rationale for phytosanitary requirements. The whole process from initiation to pest risk
    management should be sufficiently documented so that when a review or a dispute arises, the sources
    of information and rationale used in reaching the management decision can be clearly demonstrated.
    The main elements of documentation are:
    -    purpose for the PRA
    -    pest, pest list, pathways, PRA area, endangered area
    -    sources of information
    -    categorized pest list
    -    conclusions of risk assessment

     This annex was adopted as part of a supplement by the Fifth Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures
                                                           in April 2003.

S1   ANNEX 1: Comments on the scope of the IPPC in regard to environmental risks
     The range of pests covered by the IPPC extends beyond pests directly affecting cultivated plants. The
     coverage of the IPPC definition of pests includes plants as pests and other species that have indirect
     effects on plants, and the Convention applies to the protection of wild flora. The scope of the IPPC also
     extends to organisms that are pests because they:
     -      directly affect uncultivated/unmanaged plants
     Introduction of these pests may have few commercial consequences, and therefore they have been less
     likely to be evaluated, regulated and/or placed under official control. An example of this type of pest is
     Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma novo-ulmi).
     -     indirectly affect plants
     In addition to pests that directly affect host plants, there are those, like most plants as pests (e.g. weeds
     and invasive plants), that affect plants primarily by other processes such as competition.
     -     indirectly affect plants through effects on other organisms
     Some pests may primarily affect other organisms, but thereby cause deleterious effects on plant species,
     or plant health in habitats or ecosystems. Examples include parasites of beneficial organisms, such as
     biological control agents.
     To protect the environment and biological diversity without creating disguised barriers to trade,
     environmental risks and risks to biological diversity should be analysed in a PRA.

      ISPM 11                                                            Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests – Annex 2


      This annex was adopted by the Sixth Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March–April 2004.
                                          The annex is a prescriptive part of the standard.

S2   ANNEX 2: Comments on the scope of the IPPC in regard to pest risk analysis for living
     modified organisms
     Phytosanitary risks that may be associated with a living modified organism are within the scope of the
     International Plant Protection Convention and should be considered using pest risk analysis to make
     decisions regarding pest risk management.
     The analysis of LMOs includes consideration of the following:
     -     Some LMOs may present a phytosanitary risk and therefore warrant a PRA. However other LMOs
           will not present a phytosanitary risks beyond those posed by related non-LMOs and therefore will
           not warrant a complete PRA. For example, modifications to change the physiological
           characteristics of a plant (e.g. ripening time, storage life) may not present any phytosanitary risk.
           The pest risk that may be posed by an LMO is dependent on a combination of factors, including
           the characteristics of the donor and recipient organisms, the genetic alteration, and the specific
           new trait or traits. Therefore, part of the supplementary text (see Annex 3) provides guidance on
           how to determine if an LMO is a potential pest.
     -     PRA may constitute only a portion of the overall risk analysis for import and release of a LMO.
           For example, countries may require the assessment of risks to human or animal health, or to the
           environment, beyond that covered by the IPPC. This standard only relates to the assessment and
           management of phytosanitary risks. As with other organisms or pathways assessed by an NPPO,
           LMOs may present other risks not falling within the scope of the IPPC. When an NPPO discovers
           potential for risks that are not of phytosanitary concern it may be appropriate to notify the relevant
           authorities.
     -     Phytosanitary risks from LMOs may result from certain traits introduced into the organism, such
           as those that increase the potential for establishment and spread, or from inserted gene sequences
           that do not alter the pest characteristics of the organism but that might act independently of the
           organism or have unintended consequences.
     -     In cases of phytosanitary risks related to gene flow, the LMO is acting more as a potential vector
           or pathway for introduction of a genetic construct of phytosanitary concern rather than as a pest
           in and of itself. Therefore, the term “pest” should be understood to include the potential of an
           LMO to act as a vector or pathway for introduction of a gene presenting a potential phytosanitary
           risk.
     -     The risk analysis procedures of the IPPC are generally concerned with phenotypic characteristics
           rather than genotypic characteristics. However, genotypic characteristics may need to be
           considered when assessing the phytosanitary risks of LMOs.
     -     Potential phytosanitary risks that may be associated with LMOs could also be associated with
           non-LMOs. It may be useful to consider risks associated with LMOs in the context of risks posed
           by the non-modified recipient or parental organisms, or similar organisms, in the PRA area.

         This annex was adopted by the Sixth Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March–April 2004.
                                             The annex is a prescriptive part of the standard.

S2   ANNEX 3: Determining the potential for a living modified organism to be a pest
     This annex is relevant for living modified organisms only where there is potential for phytosanitary risks
     from the LMO associated with some characteristic or property related to the genetic modification. Other
     phytosanitary risks associated with the organism should be assessed under other appropriate sections of
     ISPM 11 or under other appropriate ISPMs.
     The information requirements outlined in section 1.3 may be needed in determining the potential for an
     LMO to be a pest.
     Potential phytosanitary risks for LMOs
     Potential phytosanitary risks for LMOs may include:
     a. Changes in adaptive characteristics which may increase the potential for introduction or spread, for
     example alterations in:
     -     tolerance to adverse environmental conditions (e.g. drought, freezing, salinity)
     -     reproductive biology
     -     dispersal ability of pests
     -     growth rate or vigour
     -     host range
     -     pest resistance
     -     pesticide (including herbicide) resistance or tolerance.
     b. Adverse effects of gene flow or gene transfer including, for example:
     -     transfer of pesticide or pest resistance genes to compatible species
     -     the potential to overcome existing reproductive and recombination barriers resulting in pest risks
     -     potential for hybridization with existing organisms or pathogens to result in pathogenicity or
           increased pathogenicity.
     c. Adverse effects on non-target organisms including, for example:
     -     changes in host range of the LMO, including the cases where it is intended for use as a biological
           control agent or organism otherwise claimed to be beneficial
     -     effects on other organisms, such as biological control agents, beneficial organisms, or soil fauna
           and microflora, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, that result in a phytosanitary impact (indirect effects)
     -     capacity to vector other pests
     -     negative direct or indirect effects of plant-produced pesticides on non-target organisms beneficial
           to plants.
     d. Genotypic and phenotypic instability including, for example:
     -        reversion of an organism intended as a biocontrol agent to a virulent form.
     e. Other injurious effects including, for example:
     -     phytosanitary risks presented by new traits in organisms that do not normally pose phytosanitary
           risk
     -     novel or enhanced capacity for virus recombination, trans-encapsidation and synergy events
           related to the presence of virus sequences
     -     phytosanitary risks resulting from nucleic acid sequences (markers, promoters, terminators etc.)
           present in the insert.


     International Plant Protection Convention                                                                   ISPM 11-29
 ISPM 11                                                    Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests – Annex 3



The potential phytosanitary risks identified above can also be associated with non-LMOs. The risk
analysis procedures of the IPPC are generally concerned with phenotypic characteristics rather than
genotypic characteristics. However, genotypic characteristics may need to be considered when assessing
the phytosanitary risks of LMOs.
If there is no indication that new traits resulting from genetic modifications have phytosanitary risks,
the LMO may require no further consideration.
It may be useful to consider potential risks in the context of risks posed by the non-modified recipients
or parental organisms, or similar organisms, in the PRA area.
In cases of phytosanitary risks related to gene flow, the LMO is acting more as a potential vector or
pathway for introduction of a genetic construct of phytosanitary concern rather than as a pest in and of
itself. Therefore, the term “pest” should be understood to include the potential of an LMO to act as a
vector or pathway for introduction of a gene presenting a potential phytosanitary risk.
Factors that may result in the need to subject a LMO to Stage 2 of the PRA include:
-     lack of knowledge about a particular modification event
-     the credibility of information if it is an unfamiliar modification event
-     insufficient data on the behaviour of the LMO in environments similar to the PRA area
-     field experience, research trials or laboratory data indicating that the LMO may pose
      phytosanitary risks (see subsections a. to e. above)
-     where the LMO expresses characteristics that are associated with pests under ISPM 11
-     existing conditions in the country (or PRA area) that may result in the LMO being a pest
-     where there are PRAs for similar organisms (including LMOs) or risk analyses carried out for
      other purposes that indicate a pest potential
-     experience in other countries.
Factors that may lead to the conclusion that an LMO is not a potential pest and/or requires no further
consideration under ISPM 11 include:
-     where the genetic modification in similar or related organisms has previously been assessed by
      the NPPO (or other recognized experts or agencies) as having no phytosanitary risk
-     where the LMO is to be confined in a reliable containment system and not be released
-     evidence from research trials that the LMO is unlikely to be a pest under the use proposed
-     experience in other countries.

        This annex was adopted by the Eighth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2013.
                                     The annex is a prescriptive part of the standard.

ANNEX 4: Pest risk analysis for plants as quarantine pests
Introduction
This annex provides specific guidance on conducting PRA to determine if a plant is a pest of cultivated
or wild plants, whether it should be regulated, and to identify phytosanitary measures that reduce the
pest risk to an acceptable level. It focuses primarily on plants proposed for import, whether as plants for
planting or for other intended uses. It does not cover the unintentional introduction of plants as
contaminating pests in commodities or conveyances.
The number and diversity of plants being moved between and within countries is increasing as
opportunities for trade increase and markets develop for new plants. Movements of plants may imply
two types of pest risk: the plant (as a pathway) may carry pests, or the plant itself may be a pest. The
risk of introducing pests with plants as a pathway has long been recognized and widely regulated.
However, pest risk posed by plants as pests requires specific consideration.
Plants as pests
Plants as pests may affect other plants through competition for space and resources, such as light,
nutrients and water, or through parasitism or allelopathy. Plants introduced to a new area may also
become pests by hybridizing with cultivated plants or wild plants.
Thus, the protection of plants as pursued through the IPPC may include considering certain plants as
pests, and taking phytosanitary measures to prevent their introduction and spread. Determining which
plants are pests is context-specific and may vary with geography, habitat, land use, time and the
perceived value of the natural resources in the endangered area. PRA should form the basis of such a
determination and subsequent decisions regarding possible regulation of the plant species as a quarantine
pest. It should be noted that plants having undergone such analysis may also require assessment of their
potential to be pathways for other pests.
The IPPC has recognized the importance of plants as pests by underscoring that the definition of “pest”
includes weeds (ICPM, 2001), and by specifically including “plants that are invasive alien species” in a
range of recommendations for action for those invasive alien species that are pests of plants (ICPM,
2005). This annex provides some specific guidance on how to apply these recommendations. The 2004
revision of ISPM 11 introduced specific elements of conducting a PRA for plants as pests that are further
elaborated in this annex.
The IPPC is concerned with pests injurious to cultivated and wild plants (see Annex 1 of this standard),
and therefore weeds and invasive plants that are injurious to other plants should be considered pests in
the IPPC context. Henceforth in this annex, the terms “weed” and “invasive plants” are not used, but
only the single term “plants as pests”2.
The remainder of the text generally follows the sequence of ISPM 11, with the corresponding sections
of the standard indicated in parentheses. In each section, guidance is provided on the analytical aspects
particular to plants as pests.
Stage 1: Initiation
Initiation points
The PRA process for plants as quarantine pests will most frequently arise in situations such as:
-      a request is made to import a plant not previously imported

2
  “Invasive plants” are often taken to mean invasive alien species in the CBD sense (see ISPM 5, Appendix 1).
The term “weed” usually refers to pests of cultivated plants. However, some countries use the term “weed”
irrespective of whether cultivated plants or wild flora are at risk, and other countries use the term “noxious weed”,
“landscape weed”, “environmental weed” or similar terms to distinguish them from plants only affecting crops.

International Plant Protection Convention                                                                 ISPM 11-31
 ISPM 11                                                     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests – Annex 4



-     a plant already available and used in a country is suspected of posing a pest risk, e.g. because of
      new evidence or anticipated changes in its intended use
-     a decision is made to review or revise phytosanitary policies.
Pre-selection
ISPM 2 (Framework for pest risk analysis) describes, as part of the initiation stage, a pre-selection step
intended for determining whether or not an organism is a pest, and provides some indicators that a plant
may be a pest. Particular attention is needed for plants that have proven to be pests elsewhere or that
have intrinsic characteristics such as high propagation rate or strong competitive or propagule dispersal
abilities. In most cases, consideration of these factors in Stage 1 of the PRA may not be sufficient to
terminate the process; however, in cases where it is clearly determined that the plant is only suited to a
specific type of habitat that does not exist in the PRA area, it may be concluded that the plant cannot
become a pest in that area and the PRA process may stop at that point.
Stage 2: Pest risk assessment
Identity of the plant (refer to section 2.1.1.1)
The species is the taxonomic level usually considered in PRA. However, in the case of cultivated plants
that may be pests, lower taxonomic levels may be used where there are scientifically sound rationales.
The taxonomic level appropriate for conducting the PRA for a particular plant as a pest should be
determined by the NPPO.
Some particular considerations regarding the identity of plants as pests may include the following:
-    The taxonomic identity of the plant may be unclear because it has been obscured by breeding or
     hybridization or is the subject of plant breeders’ rights. This is particularly relevant for
     horticultural plants. The NPPO should acquire the best possible information about the identity
     and parentage of the plant from various sources (e.g. the prospective importer, plant breeders,
     scientific literature).
-    The use of taxonomic levels below the species (i.e. subspecies, variety, cultivar) may be justified
     if there is scientific evidence demonstrating that differences in characteristics are stable and
     significantly affect phytosanitary status. Examples may include differences in adaptability to
     environmental conditions, ability to exploit resources, ability to defend against herbivores, and
     methods of reproduction or propagule dispersal.
-    The evaluation of a hybrid should be based on information specific to that hybrid where available.
     Where such information does not exist, PRA may be conducted on the parent species to determine
     their pest risk. If either parent is determined to be a pest and the associated risk is deemed
     unacceptable, this information may form the basis of the risk assessment for the hybrid. However,
     as hybrids do not always express similar characteristics to their parent species, that approach may
     significantly increase the assessment uncertainty and should be used with caution.
Presence or absence in the PRA area (refer to section 2.1.1.2)
Determination of presence or absence in the PRA area is a particular challenge for NPPOs when plants
are proposed for import because the plants may already be growing in locations (e.g. botanical gardens,
home gardens) that may not be reported. Sources of information may include horticultural, agricultural,
forestry and aquaculture publications and databases. The NPPO may need to carry out particular surveys
to obtain information on presence and distribution.
The presence or absence of wild or cultivated relatives in the PRA area should also be determined in the
case where there is scientific evidence that the plant may hybridize with such local relatives.
Intended use
The PRA should include consideration of the intended use (refer to ISPM 32 (Categorization of
commodities according to their pest risk)) of the plants as this may affect the probability of
establishment, spread and economic consequences. However, it should also be recognized that plants,
once entered, may escape or be diverted from the use for which they were originally intended.

In the case of plants for planting, significant human effort is made to ensure their continuous survival
and, in some cases, successful reproduction because of their perceived benefits. Furthermore, the plants
for planting have often been selected to be well suited for growing in the importing country. This
significantly increases the likelihood of establishment and spread. Therefore, plants for planting are
generally considered to pose the highest risk. Examples of uses, broadly in the order of decreasing risk
at the time of planting, are:
-      planting in the open landscape without management (e.g. for soil erosion control, waste water
       treatment and carbon dioxide uptake, or as aquatic plants in watercourses or ponds)
-      planting in the open landscape with management (e.g. in forestry, agriculture (including for
       biofuel), horticulture, land reclamation and golf courses, or as cover crops)
-      planting outdoors in urban areas (e.g. for amenity purposes in roadsides, parks or gardens)
-      planting indoors only.
Plants for intended uses other than planting may be considered, including for human consumption or
animal feed, processing, combustion for energy production, or research.
Habitats, locations and endangered areas
Plants imported for planting may be destined for a particular geographic location of a particular habitat.
However, the NPPO should assess:
-      the probability that the plants could establish in habitats in the PRA area other than where they
       were intended to grow (i.e. to what degree other habitats are suitable for the plant)
-      the probability that the plants could spread from the location where they were intended to grow.
The overall area of suitable habitats where the presence of the plant would result in economically
important loss constitutes the endangered area.
The analysis of suitable habitats is analogous to the analysis of host plants for other pests (in the case of
parasitic plants, both host and habitat need to be considered). The guidance provided in section 2.2.2
(and its subsections) of this standard can generally be used, substituting the terms “host” and “host
range” with “suitable habitat”.
Probability of entry (refer to section 2.2.1)
For imported plants, the probability of entry need not be assessed. Nevertheless, an estimation of the
volume, frequency and destinations of prospective imports may be needed in order to assess the
likelihood of establishment and spread.
Historical evidence of pest behaviour
The most reliable predictor of establishment, spread and potential economic consequences of a plant as
a pest is the history of that plant as a pest when introduced into new areas with similar habitats and
climate. Where such a history is documented, the assessment should use this information, comparing
whether the habitat and climate conditions are sufficiently similar in the PRA area. However, a plant
may never have been moved out of its native range where it may be controlled by naturally occurring
enemies or other biotic or abiotic factors. In such cases, no historical evidence exists of establishment,
spread or economic consequences.
Probability of establishment (refer to section 2.2.2)
The assessment of the probability of establishment should consider the suitability of the climate, other
abiotic and biotic factors (see section 2.2.2.2), and cultural practices (see section 2.2.2.3). The
assessment should compare the conditions in habitats within the PRA area to the conditions in habitats
in which the plant currently occurs. Depending on the information available, the following may be
incorporated:
-      climate: suitability of current climates and, for long-lived plants, future projected climates
-      other abiotic factors: soil characteristics, topography, hydrology, natural fires, etc.


International Plant Protection Convention                                                        ISPM 11-33
 ISPM 11                                                     Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests – Annex 4



-     biotic factors: current vegetation, degree of disturbance, presence or absence of natural enemies
      and competitors
-     cultural practices in crops or managed plant communities: herbicide usage, harvesting, soil
      cultivation, burning, etc. (including side-effects such as aerial deposition of nitrogen or
      pesticides).
Where the history of a particular plant as a pest is not well documented, the assessment should consider
intrinsic characteristics of the plant that may predict establishment (refer to section 2.2.2.4). Although
intrinsic characteristics have sometimes been shown to be poor predictors, the following may be
considered:
-      reproductive characteristics: sexual and asexual mechanisms, dioecism, duration of flowering,
       self-compatibility, reproduction frequency, generation time
-      adaptive potential (of individuals and populations): genotypic or phenotypic plasticity,
       hybridization potential
-      propagule attributes: volume and viability, dormancy
-      tolerance or resistance: response to pests, herbicides, grazing and other cultural practices,
       drought, flooding, frost, salinity, climate changes.
Many plants as pests are opportunists with a strong potential to become established in disturbed habitats.
Plants with a robust dormancy combined with a prolific reproductive ability are particularly suited for
such an opportunistic strategy. Disturbed habitats are common; therefore, plants with such opportunistic
adaptations may encounter many opportunities for establishment and spread.
Probability of spread (refer to section 2.2.3)
The likelihood and extent of spread depends on natural and human-mediated factors. Natural factors
may include:
-     intrinsic characteristics of the plant species (in particular regarding reproduction, adaptation and
      propagule dispersal)
-     existence of natural means of spread (e.g. birds and other animals, water, wind)
-     existence and spatial pattern of suitable habitats and dispersal corridors connecting them.
Human-mediated factors, whether intentional or unintentional, may include:
-   intended use, consumer demand, economic value and ease of transport
-   the movement of propagules of contaminating pests with soil or other materials (e.g. clothing,
    conveyances, machinery, tools, equipment)
-   the discarding of plants (e.g. after flowering or when private aquaria are emptied)
-   disposal procedures (e.g. composting) for waste that contains plants.
There are often long time lags between a plant’s initial introduction and its later spread. As a
consequence, even in the cases where establishment may be well documented, the potential for later
spread may be less known. If evidence exists, the following factors may need to be considered:
-     changes in abiotic factors (e.g. an increase in aerial deposition of nitrogen or sulphur)
-     changes in the genetic profile of the plant species (e.g. through natural selection, genetic drift)
-     long generative time or time to maturity
-     emergence of novel uses for the plant
-     relatively rare dispersal events that move propagules from suboptimal to optimal habitats
-     changes in land use or disturbance pattern (e.g. following natural floods, natural fires)
-     changes in climate (e.g. warmer climate changes in precipitation patterns).

 Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including – Annex 4                                        ISPM 11



Assessment of potential economic consequences (refer to section 2.3)
Plants as pests may have a variety of economic consequences, including yield losses in agriculture,
horticulture and forestry; reduction of recreational value; or reduction of biodiversity and negative
effects on other parts of the ecosystem. Assessment of economic consequences of plants as pests may
be inherently difficult because they may have broad agricultural, environmental and social consequences
that may be non-specific, not readily apparent or not easily quantified (e.g. changes in the soil’s nutrient
profile).
It is important to consider the potential long-term economic consequences for the entire PRA area,
including where the plants are intended to grow. The most reliable predictor of potential economic
consequences is evidence of consequences elsewhere, particularly in areas with similar habitats.
However, in some cases, plants have never been moved out of their native ranges and therefore may not
have had an opportunity to express any potential consequences. In the absence of evidence of economic
consequences elsewhere, consideration may be given to whether or not the plant possesses intrinsic
characteristics that predict pest potential, such as those discussed above and in section 2.2.2.4 related to
establishment and spread.
Stage 3: Pest risk management (refer to section 3.4)
Plants for planting will usually be introduced into habitats suitable for their establishment and growth.
In such cases, most pest risk management options would be counterproductive to the intended use. In
general, for plants for planting considered quarantine pests, the most effective risk management option
is prohibition (refer to section 3.4.6). However, those plants may at the same time have a perceived
benefit that may be considered in the decision-making process following the PRA.
For specific situations, other pest risk management options may be pursued, including:
-     requirements for growing plants under confinement
-     requirements for harvesting plants at a certain stage or specified time to prevent opportunities for
      reproduction
-     restriction of plants to particular locations, such as those that are marginally suitable
-     restriction of import to specified cultivars or clones
-     restrictions on the disposal of excess or waste plant material
-     other restrictions on planting, growing, sale, holding, transport or disposal
-     considering the use of codes of conduct for sale, holding, transport, planting or disposal, for
      example, in the form of internal rules or guidelines within the plant industry to refrain from or
      restrict the selling of particular plants for specific intended uses.
For plants imported for consumption or processing, risk management options may include restrictions
on transport, storage, locations of import and use, sale, waste disposal, time of year import takes place,
and requirements regarding the processing or treatments (e.g. devitalization).
In identifying risk management options, the suitability of control measures, ease of detection,
identification of and access to the plants, time needed for effective control and difficulty of eradication
or containment should be considered. For example, plants in highly managed systems such as cropping
systems may be more easily controlled than plants in natural or semi-natural habitats, or in private
gardens. Many of the factors considered under “establishment” and “spread” also influence a plant’s
response to control measures and thus the feasibility of control.
In cases where the assessed plants are present in collections (e.g. botanical gardens) and import
regulation is considered, phytosanitary measures may have to be applied to those collections.
Irrespective of risk management options, where the import of a plant is allowed, it may be appropriate
to develop post-entry systems such as surveillance in the PRA area, contingency plans, and systems to
report new occurrences.

Aspects common to all PRA stages
Risk communication (refer to ISPM 2)
Plants intentionally introduced for planting may not be perceived as a threat by the public, or by
particular stakeholders, who may perceive the plants as purely beneficial. Furthermore, in many
countries authorities other than the NPPO have responsibilities under the Convention of Biological
Diversity with regard to plants intentionally introduced for planting. Therefore, risk communication may
be particularly important in relation to plants as pests.
Risk communication may include for example:
-     consultation with importers, research institutes and other governmental and non-governmental
      organizations (e.g. environmental protection agencies, parks departments, nurseries, landscapers)
      to exchange information on plants as potential pests
-     publication of lists of plants as quarantine pests
-     labelling of plants in commerce (e.g. explaining the pest risk the plants may pose and under which
      conditions the pest risk may occur).
