Adoption
This standard was adopted by the Sixth Session of the Interim Commission on Phytosanitary Measures
in March–April 2004. Annex 1 was adopted by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April
2017. Annex 2 was adopted by the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March 2023.

INTRODUCTION

Scope
This standard describes the structure and operation of a phytosanitary import regulatory system and the
rights, obligations and responsibilities which should be considered in establishing, operating and
revising the system.

phytosanitary terms).

Outline of requirements
The objective of a phytosanitary import regulatory system is to prevent the introduction of quarantine
pests or limit the entry of regulated non-quarantine pests with imported commodities and other regulated
articles. A phytosanitary import regulatory system should consist of two components: a regulatory
framework of phytosanitary legislation, phytosanitary regulations and phytosanitary procedures; and an
official service, the national plant protection organization (NPPO), responsible for operation or
oversight of the system. The legal framework should include legal authority for the NPPO to carry out
its duties; phytosanitary measures with which imported commodities should comply; other
phytosanitary measures (including prohibitions) concerning imported commodities and other regulated
articles; and phytosanitary actions that may be taken when incidents of non-compliance or incidents
requiring emergency action are detected. It may include phytosanitary measures concerning
consignments in transit.
In operating a phytosanitary import regulatory system, the NPPO has a number of responsibilities. These
include the responsibilities identified in Article IV.2 of the IPPC relating to import including
surveillance, inspection, disinfestation or disinfection, the conduct of pest risk analysis, and training and
development of staff. These responsibilities involve related functions in areas such as administration;
audit and compliance checking; action taken on non-compliance; emergency action; authorization of
personnel; and settlement of disputes. In addition, contracting parties may assign to NPPOs other
responsibilities, such as regulatory development and modification. NPPO resources are needed to carry
out these responsibilities and functions. There are also requirements for international and national
liaison, documentation, communication and review.

 ISPM 20                                                Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



REQUIREMENTS

1.    Objective
The objective of a phytosanitary import regulatory system is to prevent the introduction of quarantine
pests or limit the entry of regulated non-quarantine pests (RNQPs) with imported commodities and other
regulated articles.

2.    Structure
The components of a phytosanitary import regulatory system are:
-     a regulatory framework of phytosanitary legislation, phytosanitary regulations and phytosanitary
      procedures;
-     an NPPO that is responsible for the operation of the system.
Legal and administrative systems and structures differ among contracting parties. In particular, some
legal systems require every aspect of the work of its officials to be detailed within a legal text whilst
others provide a broad framework within which officials have the delegated authority to perform their
functions through a largely administrative procedure. This standard accordingly provides general
guidelines for the regulatory framework of a phytosanitary import regulatory system. This regulatory
framework is further described in section 4.
The NPPO is the official service responsible for the operation or oversight (organization and
management) of the phytosanitary import regulatory system. Other government services, such as the
Customs service, may have a role (with defined separation of responsibilities and functions) in the
control of imported commodities and liaison should be maintained. The NPPO often utilizes its own
officers to operate the phytosanitary import regulatory system, but may authorize other appropriate
government services, or non-governmental organizations, or persons to act on its behalf and under its
control for defined functions. The operation of the system is described in section 5.

3.    Rights, obligations and responsibilities
In establishing and operating its phytosanitary import regulatory system, the NPPO should take into
account:
-      rights, obligations and responsibilities arising from relevant international treaties, conventions or
       agreements;
-      rights, obligations and responsibilities arising from relevant international standards;
-      national legislation and policies;
-      administrative policies of the government, ministry or department, or NPPO.

3.1   International agreements, principles and standards
National governments have the sovereign right to regulate imports to achieve their appropriate level of
protection, taking into account their international obligations. Rights, obligations and responsibilities
associated with international agreements as well as the principles and standards resulting from
international agreements, in particular the IPPC and the World Trade Organization Agreement on the
Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (WTO, 1994), affect the structure and
implementation of phytosanitary import regulatory systems. These include effects on the drafting and
adoption of phytosanitary import regulations, the application of phytosanitary regulations, and the
operational activities arising from regulations.
The drafting, adoption and application of phytosanitary regulations require recognition of certain
principles and concepts such as in ISPM 1 (Phytosanitary principles for the protection of plants and the
application of phytosanitary measures in international trade), including:
-     transparency;


ISPM 20-8                                                        International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system                                         ISPM 20



-      sovereignty;
-      necessity;
-      non-discrimination;
-      minimal impact;
-      harmonization;
-      technical justification (such as through pest risk analysis (PRA));
-      consistency;
-      managed risk;
-      modification;
-      emergency action and provisional measures;
-      equivalence;
-      recognition of pest free areas and areas of low pest prevalence.
In particular, the phytosanitary procedures and phytosanitary regulations should take into consideration
the concept of minimal impact and issues of economic and operational feasibility in order to avoid
unnecessary trade disruption.

3.2    Regional cooperation
Regional organizations, such as regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs) and regional
agricultural development organizations, may encourage the harmonization of their members’
phytosanitary import regulatory systems and may cooperate in the exchange of information for the
benefit of members.
A regional economic integration organization recognized by FAO may have rules that apply to its
members and may also have the authority to enact and enforce certain phytosanitary regulations on
behalf of members of that organization.

4.     Regulatory framework
The issuing of regulations is a government (contracting party) responsibility (Article IV.3(c) of the
IPPC). Consistent with this responsibility, contracting parties may provide the NPPO with the authority
for the formulation of phytosanitary import regulations and the implementation of the import regulatory
system. Contracting parties should have a regulatory framework to provide the following:
-      the specification of the responsibilities and functions of the NPPO in relation to the import
       regulatory system;
-      legal authority to enable the NPPO to carry out its responsibilities and functions with respect to
       the import regulatory system;
-      authority and procedures, such as through PRA, to determine import phytosanitary measures;
-      phytosanitary measures that apply to imported commodities and other regulated articles;
-      import prohibitions that apply to imported commodities and other regulated articles;
-      legal authority for action with respect to non-compliance and for emergency action;
-      the specification of interactions between the NPPO and other government bodies;
-      transparent and defined procedures and time frames for implementation of regulations, including
       their entry into force.
Contracting parties have obligations to make their regulations available according to Article VII.2(b) of
the IPPC; these procedures may require a regulatory basis.

4.1    Regulated articles
Imported commodities that may be regulated include articles that may be infested or contaminated with
regulated pests. Regulated pests are either quarantine pests or regulated non-quarantine pests. All

International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 20-9
 ISPM 20                                                      Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



commodities can be regulated for quarantine pests. Products for consumption or processing cannot be
regulated for regulated non-quarantine pests. Regulated non-quarantine pests can only be regulated with
respect to plants for planting. The following are examples of regulated articles:
-     plants and plant products used for planting, consumption, processing, or any other purpose;
-     storage facilities;
-     packaging materials including dunnage;
-     conveyances and transport facilities;
-     soil, organic fertilizers and related materials;
-     organisms capable of harbouring or spreading pests;
-     potentially contaminated equipment (such as used agricultural, military and earthmoving
      equipment);
-     research and other scientific materials;
-     travellers’ personal effects moving internationally;
-     international mail including international courier services;
-     pests and biological control agents.1
Lists of regulated articles should be made publicly available.

4.2    Phytosanitary measures for regulated articles
Contracting parties should not apply phytosanitary measures to the entry of regulated articles such as
prohibitions, restrictions or other phytosanitary import requirements unless such measures are made
necessary by phytosanitary considerations and are technically justified. Contracting parties should take
into account, as appropriate, international standards and other relevant requirements and considerations
of the IPPC when applying phytosanitary measures.

4.2.1 Phytosanitary measures for consignments to be imported
The phytosanitary regulations should specify the phytosanitary measures with which imported
consignments of plants, plant products and other regulated articles should comply.2 These phytosanitary
measures may be general, applying to all types of commodities, or the measures may be specific,
applying to specified commodities from a particular origin. Phytosanitary measures may be required
prior to entry, at entry or post entry. Systems approaches may also be used when appropriate (see
ISPM 14 (The use of integrated measures in a systems approach for pest risk management)).
Phytosanitary measures required in the exporting country, which the NPPO of the exporting country
may be required to certify (ISPM 7 (Phytosanitary certification system)) include:
-     inspection prior to export;
-     testing prior to export;
-     treatment prior to export;
-     produced from plants of specified phytosanitary status (for example grown from virus-tested
      plants or under specified conditions);
-     inspection or testing in the growing season prior to export;



1
  Pests per se and biological control agents do not fall within the definition of “regulated articles” (Article II.1 of
the IPPC). However, where there is technical justification, they may be subjected to phytosanitary measures (IPPC,
Article VI with respect to regulated pests, and Article VII.1(c) and VII.1(d)) and for the purposes of this standard
may be considered as regulated articles.
2
  For the purpose of this standard, import is considered to cover all consignments moving into the country (except
in transit), including movement into free trade zones (including duty free areas and consignments in bond) and
illegal consignments detained by other services.

ISPM 20-10                                                              International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system                                          ISPM 20



-      origin of the consignment to be a pest free place of production or pest free production site, area
       of low pest prevalence or pest free area;
-      accreditation procedures;
-      maintenance of consignment integrity.
Phytosanitary measures that may be required during shipment include:
-     treatment (for example appropriate physical or chemical treatments);
-     maintenance of consignment integrity.
Phytosanitary measures that may be required at the point of entry include:
-     documentation checks;
-     verification of consignment integrity;
-     verification of treatment during shipment;
-     phytosanitary inspection;
-     testing;
-     treatment;
-     detention of consignments pending the results of testing or verification of the efficacy of
      treatment.
Phytosanitary measures that may be required after entry include:
-     detention in quarantine (such as in a post-entry quarantine station) for inspection, testing or
      treatment;
-     detention at a designated place pending specified measures;
-     restrictions on the distribution or use of the consignment (for example for specified processing).
Other phytosanitary measures that may be required include:
-     requirements for licences or permits;
-     limitations on the points of entry for specified commodities;
-     the requirement that importers notify in advance the arrival of specified consignments;
-     audit of procedures in the exporting country;
-     pre-clearance.
The phytosanitary import regulatory system should make provision for the evaluation and possible
acceptance of alternative phytosanitary measures proposed by exporting contracting parties as being
equivalent.

4.2.1.1 Provision for special imports
Contracting parties may make special provision for the import of pests, biological control agents (see
also ISPM 3 (Guidelines for the export, shipment, import and release of biological control agents and
other beneficial organisms)) or other regulated articles for scientific research, education or other
purposes. Such imports may be authorized subject to the provision of adequate safeguards.

4.2.1.2 Pest free areas, pest free places of production, pest free production sites, areas of
      low pest prevalence and official control programmes
Importing contracting parties may designate pest free areas, areas of low pest prevalence (ISPM 4
(Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas), ISPM 22 (Requirements for the establishment
of areas of low pest prevalence), ISPM 29 (Recognition of pest free areas and areas of low pest
prevalence)) and official control programmes within their country. Phytosanitary regulations may be
required to protect or sustain such designations within the importing country. However such
phytosanitary measures should respect the principle of non-discrimination.


International Plant Protection Convention                                                     ISPM 20-11
 ISPM 20                                                Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



Phytosanitary import regulations should recognize the existence of such designations and those related
to other official procedures (such as pest free places of production and pest free production sites) within
the countries of exporting contracting parties including the facility to recognize these phytosanitary
measures as equivalent where appropriate. It may be necessary to make provision within phytosanitary
regulatory systems to evaluate and accept the designations by other NPPOs and to respond accordingly.

4.2.2 Import authorization
The authority to import may be provided as a general authorization or through specific authorization on
a case-by-case basis.
General import authorization
General import authorizations may be used:
-    when there are no specific phytosanitary import requirements;
-    where specific phytosanitary import requirements have been established permitting entry as set
     out in the regulations for a range of commodities.
General import authorizations should not require a licence or a permit but may be subject to checking
at import.
Specific import authorization
Specific import authorizations, e.g. in the form of a licence or permit, may be required where official
consent for import is necessary. These may be required for individual consignments or a series of
consignments of a particular origin. Cases where this type of authorization may be required include:
-     emergency or exceptional imports;
-     imports with specific, individual phytosanitary import requirements such as those with post-entry
      quarantine requirements or designated end use or research purposes;
-     imports where the NPPO requires the ability to trace the material over a period of time after entry.
It is noted that some countries may use permits to specify general import conditions. However, the
development of general authorizations is encouraged wherever similar specific authorizations become
routine.

4.2.3 Prohibitions
The prohibition of import may apply to specified commodities or other regulated articles of all origins
or specifically to a particular commodity or other regulated article of a specified origin. The prohibition
of import should be used when no alternatives for pest risk management exist. Prohibitions should be
technically justified. NPPOs should make provision to assess equivalent, but less trade restrictive
measures. Contracting parties, through their NPPOs where authorized, should modify their
phytosanitary import regulations if such measures meet their appropriate level of protection. Prohibition
applies to quarantine pests. Regulated non-quarantine pests should not be subject to prohibition but are
subject to established pest tolerance levels.
Prohibited articles may be required for research or other purpose and provision may be required for their
import under controlled conditions including appropriate safeguards through a system of licence or
permit.

4.3   Consignments in transit
Consignments in transit are not imported. However, the phytosanitary import regulatory system may be
extended to cover consignments in transit and to establish technically justified phytosanitary measures
to prevent the introduction and/or spread of pests (Article VII.4 of the IPPC, ISPM 25 (Consignments
in transit)). Measures may be required to track consignments, to verify their integrity or to confirm that
they leave the country of transit. Countries may establish points of entry, routes within the country,
conditions for transportation and time spans permitted within their territories.

ISPM 20-12                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system                                        ISPM 20



4.4    Measures concerning non-compliance and emergency action
The phytosanitary import regulatory system should include provisions for phytosanitary action to be
taken in the case of non-compliance or for emergency action (Article VII.2(f) of the IPPC; detailed
information is contained in ISPM 13 (Guidelines for the notification of non-compliance and emergency
action)), taking into consideration the principle of minimal impact.
Phytosanitary actions which may be taken when an imported consignment or other regulated articles
does not comply with phytosanitary regulations and is initially refused entry include:
-     treatment;
-     sorting or reconditioning;
-     disinfection of regulated articles (including equipment, premises, storage areas, means of
      transportation);
-     direction to a particular end use such as processing;
-     reshipment;
-     destruction (such as incineration).
Detection of a non-compliance or an incident requiring emergency action may result in a revision of the
phytosanitary import regulations, or in revocation or suspension of authorization to import.

4.5    Other elements that may require a regulatory framework
International agreements give rise to obligations which may require a legal base or may be implemented
through administrative procedures. Arrangements that may require such procedures include:
-     notification of non-compliance;
-     pest reporting;
-     designation of an official contact point;
-     publication and dissemination of regulatory information;
-     international cooperation;
-     revision of regulations and documentation;
-     recognition of equivalence;
-     specification of points of entry;
-     notification of official documentation.

4.6    Legal authority for the NPPO
In order that the NPPO can discharge its responsibilities (Article IV of the IPPC), legal authority
(powers) should be provided to enable the officers of the NPPO and other authorized persons to:
-     enter premises, conveyances, and other places where imported commodities, regulated pests or
      other regulated articles may be present;
-     inspect or test imported commodities and other regulated articles;
-     take and remove samples from imported commodities or other regulated articles, or from places
      where regulated pests may be present (including for analysis which may result in the destruction
      of the sample);
-     detain imported consignments or other regulated articles;
-     treat or require treatment of imported consignments, or other regulated articles including
      conveyances, or places or commodities in which a regulated pest may be present;
-     refuse entry of consignments, order their reshipment or destruction;
-     take emergency action;
-     set and collect fees for import-related activities or associated with penalties (optional).



International Plant Protection Convention                                                   ISPM 20-13
 ISPM 20                                                Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



5.    Operation of a phytosanitary import regulatory system
The NPPO is responsible for the operation or oversight (organization and management) of the
phytosanitary import regulatory system (see also section 2). This responsibility arises in particular from
Article IV.2 of the IPPC.

5.1   Management and operational responsibilities of the NPPO
The NPPO should have a management system and resources adequate to carry out its functions.

5.1.1 Administration
The administration of the phytosanitary import regulatory system by the NPPO should ensure the
effective and consistent application of phytosanitary legislation and regulations and compliance with
international obligations. This may require operational coordination with other government services or
government agencies involved with imports, e.g. Customs. Administration of the phytosanitary import
regulatory system should be coordinated at national level but may be organized on a functional, regional
or other structural basis.

5.1.2 Regulatory development and revision
The issuing of phytosanitary regulations is a contracting party responsibility (Article IV.3(c) of the
IPPC). Consistent with this responsibility, contracting parties may make the development or revision of
phytosanitary regulations the responsibility of their NPPO. This action may be under the initiative of
the NPPO in consultation or cooperation with other authorities as appropriate. Appropriate regulations
should be developed, maintained and reviewed as necessary and in compliance with applicable
international agreements, through the normal legal and consultative processes of the country.
Consultation and collaboration with relevant agencies as well as affected industries and appropriate
private sector groups can be helpful in increasing the understanding and acceptance of regulatory
decisions by the private sector and is often useful for the improvement of regulations.

5.1.3 Surveillance
The technical justification of phytosanitary measures is determined in part by the pest status of regulated
pests within the regulating country. Pest status may change and this may necessitate revision of
phytosanitary import regulations. Surveillance of cultivated and non-cultivated plants in the importing
country is required to maintain adequate information on pest status (according to ISPM 6 (Guidelines
for surveillance)), and may be required to support PRA and pest listing.

5.1.4 Pest risk analysis and pest listing
Technical justification such as through PRA is required to determine if pests should be regulated and
the strength of phytosanitary measures to be taken against them (ISPM 11 (Pest risk analysis for
quarantine pests); ISPM 21 (Pest risk analysis for regulated non-quarantine pests)). PRA may be done
on a specific pest or on all the pests associated with a particular pathway (e.g. a commodity). A
commodity may be classified by its level of processing or its intended use (see ISPM 32 (Categorization
of commodities according to their pest risk)). Regulated pests should be listed (according to ISPM 19
(Guidelines on lists of regulated pests)) and lists of regulated pests should be made available
(Article VII.2(i) of the IPPC). If appropriate international standards are available, measures should take
account of such standards and should not be more stringent unless technically justified.
The administrative framework of the PRA process should be clearly documented, if possible with a time
frame for the completion of individual PRAs and with clear guidance on prioritization.

5.1.5 Audit and compliance procedures
5.1.5.1 Audit of procedures in the exporting country
Phytosanitary import regulations often include specific requirements that should be done in the country
of export, such as production procedures (usually during the growing period of the crop concerned) or

ISPM 20-14                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system                                           ISPM 20



specialized treatment procedures. In certain circumstances, such as in the development of a new trade,
the requirements may include, in cooperation with the NPPO of the exporting country, an audit in the
exporting country by the NPPO of the importing country of elements such as:
-      production systems;
-      treatments;
-      inspection procedures;
-      phytosanitary management;
-      accreditation procedures;
-      testing procedures;
-      surveillance.
An importing country should make known the scope of any audit. The arrangements for such audits are
normally written into a bilateral agreement, arrangement or work programme associated with import
facilitation. Such arrangements may extend to clearance of consignments within the exporting country
for entry into the importing country which usually facilitates a minimum of procedures at entry to the
importing country. These types of audit procedure should not be applied as a permanent measure and
should be considered satisfied as soon as the procedures in the exporting country have been validated.
This approach, in its limitation on the length of its application, may differ from ongoing pre-clearance
inspections mentioned in section 5.1.5.2.1. The results of audits should be made available to the NPPO
of the exporting country.

5.1.5.2 Compliance procedures at import
There are three basic elements to compliance checking:
-     documentary checks;
-     verification of consignment integrity;
-     phytosanitary inspection, testing, etc.
Verification of compliance for imported consignments and other regulated articles may be required:
-     to determine their compliance with phytosanitary regulations;
-     to check that phytosanitary measures are effective in preventing the introduction of quarantine
      pests and limiting the entry of RNQPs;
-     to detect potential quarantine pests or quarantine pests whose entry with that commodity was not
      predicted.
Phytosanitary inspections should be carried out by, or under the authority of, the NPPO.
Compliance procedures should be undertaken promptly (Article VII.2(d) and VII.2(e) of the IPPC).
Where possible, compliance procedures should be carried out in cooperation with other agencies
involved with the regulation of imports, such as Customs, so as to minimize interference with the flow
of trade and the impact on perishable products.
5.1.5.2.1 Inspection
Inspections may be done at the point of entry, at points of transhipment, at the point of destination or at
other places where imported consignments can be identified, such as major markets, provided that their
integrity is maintained and that appropriate phytosanitary procedures can be carried out. By bilateral
agreement or arrangement, they may also be done in the country of origin as a part of a pre-clearance
programme in cooperation with the NPPO of the exporting country.
Phytosanitary inspections, which should be technically justified, may be applied:
-     to all consignments as a condition of entry;
-     as a part of an import monitoring programme where the level of monitoring (i.e. the number of
      consignments inspected) is established on the basis of predicted risk.

International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 20-15
 ISPM 20                                               Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



Inspection and sampling procedures may be based on general procedures or on specific procedures to
achieve predetermined objectives.
5.1.5.2.2 Sampling
Samples may be taken from consignments for the purposes of inspection, or for subsequent laboratory
testing, or for reference purposes (see ISPM 31 (Methodologies for sampling of consignments)).
5.1.5.2.3 Testing including laboratory testing
Testing may be required for:
-     identification of a visually detected pest;
-     confirmation of a visually identified pest;
-     checking of compliance with requirements concerning infestations not detectable by inspection;
-     checking for latent infections;
-     audit or monitoring;
-     reference purposes particularly in cases of non-compliance;
-     verification of the declared product.
Testing should be performed by persons experienced in the appropriate procedures and, if possible,
following internationally agreed protocols. Cooperation with appropriate academic and international
experts or institutes is recommended when validation of test results is needed.

5.1.6 Non-compliance and emergency action
Detailed information about non-compliance and emergency action is contained in ISPM 13.

5.1.6.1 Action in case of non-compliance
Examples where phytosanitary action may be justified regarding non-compliance with phytosanitary
import regulations include:
-     the detection of a listed quarantine pest associated with consignments for which it is regulated;
-     the detection of a listed RNQP present in an imported consignment of plants for planting at a level
      which exceeds the required tolerance level for those plants;
-     evidence of failure to meet prescribed requirements (including bilateral agreements or
      arrangements, or import permit conditions) such as field inspection, laboratory tests, registration
      of producers or facilities, lack of pest monitoring or surveillance;
-     the interception of a consignment which does not otherwise comply with the import regulations,
      such as because of the detected presence of undeclared commodities, soil or some other prohibited
      article or evidence of failure of specified treatments;
-     phytosanitary certificate or other required documentation invalid or missing;
-     prohibited consignments or articles;
-     failure to meet “in-transit” measures.
The type of phytosanitary action will vary with the circumstances and should be the minimum necessary
to counter the pest risk identified. Administrative errors such as incomplete phytosanitary certificates
may be resolved through liaison with the NPPO of the exporting country. Other infringements may
require action such as:
      Detention. This may be used if further information is required, taking into account the need to
      avoid consignment damage as far as possible.
      Sorting and reconfiguring. The affected products may be removed by sorting and reconfiguring
      the consignment including repackaging if appropriate.
      Treatment. Used by the NPPO when an efficacious treatment is available.


ISPM 20-16                                                      International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system                                            ISPM 20



       Destruction. The consignment may be destroyed in cases where the NPPO considers the
       consignment cannot be otherwise handled.
       Reshipment. The non-complying consignment may be removed from the country by reshipping.
In the case of non-compliance for an RNQP, action should be consistent with domestic measures and
limited to bringing the pest incidence in the consignment, where feasible, into compliance with the
required tolerance level, e.g. through treatment or by downgrading or reclassification where this is
permitted for equivalent material produced or regulated domestically.
The NPPO is responsible for issuing the necessary instructions and for verifying their application.
Enforcement is normally considered to be a function of the NPPO but other agencies may be authorized
to assist.
An NPPO may decide not to apply phytosanitary action against a regulated pest or in other instances of
non-compliance where phytosanitary actions are not technically justified in a particular situation, such
as if there is no risk of establishment or spread (e.g. a change of intended use such as from consumption
to processing or when a pest is in a stage of its life cycle which will not enable establishment or spread),
or for some other reason.

5.1.6.2 Emergency action
Emergency action may be required in a new or unexpected phytosanitary situation, such as the detection
of quarantine pests or potential quarantine pests:
-     in consignments for which phytosanitary measures are not specified;
-     in consignments or other regulated articles in which their presence is not anticipated and for which
      no phytosanitary measures have been specified;
-     as contaminating pests of conveyances, storage places or other places involved with imported
      commodities.
Phytosanitary action similar to that required in cases of non-compliance may be appropriate. Such
actions may lead to the modification of existing phytosanitary measures, or the adoption of provisional
measures pending review and full technical justification.
Commonly encountered situations requiring emergency action include:
    Pests not previously assessed. Non-listed organisms may require emergency phytosanitary
    actions because they may not have been previously assessed. At the time of interception, they
    may be categorized as regulated pests on a preliminary basis because the NPPO has a cause to
    believe they pose a pest risk. In such instances, it is the responsibility of the NPPO to be able to
    provide a sound technical basis. If provisional measures are established, the NPPO should actively
    pursue additional information, if appropriate with the participation of the NPPO of the exporting
    country, and complete a PRA to establish in a timely manner the regulated or non-regulated status
    of the pest.
       Pests not regulated for a particular pathway. Emergency phytosanitary actions may be applied
       for pests that are not regulated with respect to particular pathways. Although regulated, these pests
       may not have been listed or otherwise specified because they were not anticipated for the origin,
       commodity, or circumstances for which the list or measure was developed. Such pests should be
       included on the appropriate list or within other measure if it is determined that the occurrence of
       the pest in the same and similar circumstances may be anticipated in the future.
       Lack of adequate identification. In some instances, a pest may justify phytosanitary action because
       the pest cannot be adequately identified or is inadequately described taxonomically. This may be
       because the specimen has not been described (is taxonomically unknown), is in a condition which
       does not allow its identification, or the life stage being examined cannot be identified to the
       required taxonomic level. Where identification is not feasible, the NPPO should have a sound
       technical basis for the phytosanitary actions taken.

International Plant Protection Convention                                                       ISPM 20-17
 ISPM 20                                                Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



      Where pests are routinely detected in a form that does not allow for adequate identification
      (e.g. eggs, early instar larvae, imperfect forms), every effort should be made to raise sufficient
      specimens to allow identification. Contact with the exporting country may assist with the
      identification or provide a presumed identification. Such pests in this state may be deemed
      temporarily to require phytosanitary measures. Once identification is achieved and if, on the basis
      of PRA, it is confirmed that such pests justify phytosanitary actions, NPPOs should add such pests
      to the relevant list of regulated pests, noting the identification problem and the basis for requiring
      phytosanitary actions. Interested contracting parties should be informed that future action will be
      based on a presumed identification if such forms are detected. However, such future phytosanitary
      action should only be taken with respect to origins where there is an identified pest risk and the
      possibility of the presence of quarantine pests in imported consignments cannot be excluded.

5.1.6.3 Reporting of non-compliance and emergency action
The reporting of interceptions, instances of non-compliance and emergency action is an obligation for
contracting parties to the IPPC so that the NPPOs of the exporting countries understand the basis for
phytosanitary actions taken against their products on import and to facilitate corrective action in export
systems. Systems are needed for the collection and transmission of such information.

5.1.6.4 Withdrawal or modification of phytosanitary regulation
In the case of repeated non-compliance, or where a significant non-compliance or interception
warranting emergency action occurs, the NPPO of the importing contracting party may withdraw the
authorization (e.g. permit) allowing import, modify the phytosanitary regulation, or institute an
emergency or provisional measure with modified entry procedures or a prohibition. The NPPO of the
exporting country should be notified promptly of the change and rationale for this change.

5.1.7 Systems for authorization of non-NPPO personnel
NPPOs may authorize, under their control and responsibility, other government services, non-
governmental organizations, agencies or persons to act on their behalf for certain defined functions. In
order to ensure that the requirements of the NPPO are met, operational procedures are required. In
addition, procedures should be developed for the demonstration of competency and for audits, corrective
actions, system review and withdrawal of authorization.

5.1.8 International liaison
Contracting parties have international obligations (Articles VII and VIII of the IPPC) including the:
-     provision of an official contact point;
-     notification of specified points of entry;
-     publication and transmission of lists of regulated pests, phytosanitary import requirements, and
      prohibitions;
-     notification of non-compliance and emergency action (ISPM 13);
-     provision of the rationale for phytosanitary measures, on request;
-     provision of relevant information.
Administrative arrangements are required to ensure that these obligations are discharged efficiently and
promptly.

5.1.9 Notification and dissemination of regulatory information
5.1.9.1 New or revised phytosanitary regulations
Proposals for new or revised phytosanitary regulations should be published and provided to interested
parties on request, allowing reasonable time for comment and implementation.

 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system                                           ISPM 20



5.1.9.2 Dissemination of established regulations
Established import regulations, or relevant sections of them, should be made available to interested and
affected contracting parties as appropriate, to the IPPC Secretariat and to the RPPO(s) of which they are
a member. Through appropriate procedures, they may also be made available to other interested parties
(such as import and export industry organizations and their representatives). NPPOs are encouraged to
make import regulatory information available by publication, whenever possible using electronic means
including internet websites and linkage to these via the IPPC International Phytosanitary Portal (IPP)
(http://www.ippc.int).

5.1.10 National liaison
Procedures that facilitate cooperative action, information sharing and joint clearance activities within
the country should be established with relevant government agencies or services as appropriate.

5.1.11 Settlement of disputes
The implementation of a phytosanitary import regulatory system may give rise to disputes with the
authorities of other countries. The NPPO should establish procedures for consultation and exchange of
information with other NPPOs, and for settlement of such disputes “shall consult among themselves as
soon as possible” prior to considering calling on formal international dispute-settlement procedures
(Article XIII.1 of the IPPC).

5.2    Resources of the NPPO
Contracting parties should provide to their NPPO appropriate resources to carry out its functions
(Article IV.1 of the IPPC).

5.2.1 Staff, including training
The NPPO should:
-    employ or authorize personnel who have appropriate qualifications and skills;
-    ensure that adequate and sustained training is provided to all personnel to ensure competency in
     the areas for which they have responsibility.

5.2.2 Information
The NPPO should, as far as possible, ensure that adequate information is available to personnel, in
particular:
-      guidance documents, procedures and work instructions as appropriate covering relevant aspects
       of the operation of the phytosanitary import regulatory system;
-      the phytosanitary import regulations of its country;
-      information on its regulated pests including biology, host range, pathways, global distribution,
       detection and identification methods, treatment methods.
The NPPO should have access to information on the presence of pests in its country (preferably as pest
lists), to facilitate the categorization of pests during pest risk analysis. The NPPO should also maintain
lists of all its regulated pests. Detailed information on lists of regulated pests is contained in ISPM 19.
Where a regulated pest is present in the country, information should be maintained on its distribution,
pest free areas, official control and, in the case of an RNQP, official programmes for plants for planting.
Contracting parties should distribute information within their territory regarding regulated pests and the
means of their prevention and control, and may assign this responsibility to their NPPOs.

5.2.3 Equipment and facilities
The NPPO should ensure that adequate equipment and facilities are available for:
-    inspection, sampling, testing, surveillance and consignment verification procedures;

International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 20-19
 ISPM 20                                               Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system



-     communication and access to information (by electronic means as far as possible).

DOCUMENTATION, COMMUNICATION AND REVIEW

6.    Documentation
6.1   Procedures
The NPPO should maintain guidance documents, procedures and work instructions covering all aspects
of the operation of the phytosanitary import regulatory system. Procedures to be documented include:
-      preparation of pest lists;
-      pest risk analysis;
-      where appropriate, establishment of pest free areas, areas of low pest prevalence, pest free places
       of production or production sites, and official control programmes;
-      inspection, sampling and testing methodology (including methods for maintaining sample
       integrity);
-      action on non-compliance, including treatment;
-      notification of non-compliance;
-      notification of emergency action.

6.2   Records
Records should be kept of all actions, results and decisions concerning the regulation of imports,
following the relevant sections of ISPMs where appropriate, including:
-     documentation of pest risk analyses (in accordance with ISPM 11, and other relevant ISPMs);
-     where established, documentation of pest free areas, areas of low pest prevalence, and official
      control programmes (including information on the distribution of the pests and the phytosanitary
      measures used to maintain the pest free area or area of low pest prevalence);
-     records of inspection, sampling and testing;
-     non-compliance and emergency action (in accordance with ISPM 13).
If appropriate, records may be kept of imported consignments:
-      with specified intended uses;
-      subject to post-entry quarantine or treatment procedures;
-      requiring follow up phytosanitary action (including trace-back), according to pest risk; or
-      as necessary to manage the phytosanitary import regulatory system.

7.    Communication
The NPPO should ensure that it has communication procedures to contact:
-    importers and appropriate industry representatives;
-    NPPOs of exporting countries;
-    the Secretariat of the IPPC;
-    the secretariats of the RPPOs of which it is a member.

8.    Review mechanism
8.1   System review
The contracting party should periodically review its phytosanitary import regulatory system. This may
involve monitoring the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures, auditing the activities of the NPPO and
authorized organizations or persons, and modifying the phytosanitary legislation, regulations and
procedures as required.

 ISPM 20                                         Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 1


      This annex was adopted by the Twelfth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in April 2017.
                                   This annex is a prescriptive part of the standard.

ANNEX 1: Arrangements for the verification of compliance of consignments by the
importing country in the exporting country (2017)
The NPPO of the importing country usually verifies compliance of consignments with phytosanitary
import requirements on entry into the importing country. However, to facilitate trade logistics,
contracting parties may in some cases bilaterally or multilaterally negotiate an arrangement that allows
verification procedures to be performed by the NPPO of the importing country in the exporting country.
Such arrangements are distinct from audits of procedures in exporting countries referred to in this
standard (section 5.1.5.1).
NPPOs of the importing country and the exporting country should only establish and use a bilateral or
multilateral arrangement (hereinafter referred to as an “arrangement”) for verification procedures to be
performed on consignments of specified commodities in the exporting country on a voluntary and case-
by-case basis and for a time period agreed by both parties.
Arrangements described in this annex should not be established as a phytosanitary measure or as a
condition to allow trade.
The establishment of an arrangement may be an option to facilitate trade logistics in the following
situations:
-      to expedite consignment release at the destination;
-      when measures associated with the refusal of a consignment at the point of entry are too costly or
       difficult to apply;
-      when inspection at the point of entry adversely affects commercial packaging (e.g. the commodity
       is individually wrapped and destructive sampling is required) or commodity quality (e.g. the
       commodity is highly perishable);
-      when additional infrastructure is necessary to address instances of non-compliance.
The terms of the arrangement for a particular regulated article should be developed once the
phytosanitary import requirements have been set based on a pest risk analysis.
The arrangement should only include procedures to verify compliance of consignments with established
and published phytosanitary import requirements for the relevant commodities in accordance with this
standard and where appropriate with ISPM 23 (Guidelines for inspection). Consignments verified under
the arrangement should not be subject to the same verification procedures again at the point of entry.
The NPPO of the importing country may, however, perform other verification procedures, such as
document and identity checks, at the point of entry.
Irrespective of any arrangement between the NPPOs of the importing country and the exporting country,
issuance of phytosanitary certificates remains the exclusive responsibility of the NPPO of the exporting
country as stated in Articles I.2, IV.2(a), IV.2(b), IV.2(c), IV.2(d), IV.2(e), IV.2(g) and V.1 of the IPPC.
Any actions undertaken by the NPPO of the importing country in the exporting country under an
arrangement are subject to and must comply with the legislation of the exporting country.
The following sections provide options to be considered by NPPOs in relation to arrangements for the
verification of compliance of consignments by the NPPO of the importing country in the exporting
country.

1.    General requirements for an arrangement
An arrangement should be developed jointly by the NPPOs of the importing country and the exporting
country, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, when appropriate.



ISPM 20-22                                                             International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 1                                ISPM 20



The financial aspects of the arrangement should be agreed on by the NPPOs of the importing country
and the exporting country, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
The arrangement should be subject to regular review and a mechanism may be put in place to deal with
any changes that may arise. The conditions for reducing compliance verification activities and
suspending or terminating the arrangement should be specified on a case-by-case basis.

2.    Process for establishing an arrangement
The steps to establish an arrangement are outlined below.

2.1   Proposal
The NPPO of the importing or of the exporting country may initiate the request for an arrangement. The
proposal may be a response to a need identified by the initiating NPPO or by relevant stakeholders. The
proposal should specify the scope and objectives of as well as the reasons for the arrangement, and be
agreed on by both NPPOs.
Factors that may be considered in the proposal include:
-     timing and duration of the arrangement;
-     proposed verification levels and, when appropriate, sampling schemes for specified commodities
      and regulated pests;
-     criteria that could initiate review and evaluation of the arrangement;
-     criteria that could initiate suspension or termination of the arrangement;
-     availability of resources;
-     feasibility of programme implementation.

2.2   Evaluation
The NPPO receiving the proposal for an arrangement should undertake a timely review of the proposal
and prepare a response. Evaluation of the proposal should encompass any effects of the arrangement on
pest risk concerns, operational and economic feasibility, and regulatory aspects.

2.3   Elements
The NPPO proposing an arrangement has the primary responsibility for its development. However, on
request of the proposing NPPO, the other NPPO is encouraged to assist in its development.
Elements of the arrangement that may need to be agreed between the NPPO of the importing country
and the NPPO of the exporting country include:
-     sampling and inspection of consignments;
-     adequacy of inspection facilities;
-     testing procedures;
-     verification of treatments;
-     verification of consignment integrity;
-     the time of and location for the different steps of the verification of compliance of consignments,
      when appropriate;
-     notification to the point of entry of the arrival of consignments;
-     whether a certificate is to accompany the phytosanitary certificate;
-     availability of qualified staff to implement provisions under the arrangement;
-     timing of the activities for the verification of compliance;
-     approval procedures and expense or estimated expense for growers and exporters participating in
      the arrangement;


International Plant Protection Convention                                                     ISPM 20-23
 ISPM 20                                     Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 1



-     accommodation, transport, work health and safety, security and other logistical aspects for the
      deployed officers.
The steps of the verification of compliance will be identified by the NPPOs entering into the
arrangement.

2.4   Technical requirements
The technical requirements for an arrangement should be determined and developed on a case-by-case
basis and should be described in the arrangement.
The arrangement may include specific information on:
-     legal and regulatory authorities;
-     phytosanitary and other relevant legislation or regulations;
-     roles and responsibilities (including those of NPPOs, exporters, growers and other relevant
      stakeholders);
-     timing and duration of the activities;
-     regulated articles;
-     all regulated pests and the relevant phytosanitary measures for these pests required by the NPPO
      of the importing country;
-     phytosanitary actions such as sampling, inspection, testing, verification of treatment and
      verification of consignment integrity;
-     infrastructure and equipment used for the verification of compliance of consignments;
-     documentation to be maintained and provided by the NPPO of the exporting country to the NPPO
      of the importing country;
-     financial aspects;
-     notification of non-compliance;
-     corrective actions on a consignment following non-compliance;
-     frequency and timing of reviews of the arrangement;
-     criteria that could result in review, evaluation, suspension or termination of the arrangement.

3.    Implementation of an arrangement
The verification of compliance described in an arrangement may be subject to implementation
conditions; for example, verification may be for all exported consignments of a particular commodity
or only a percentage thereof, for categories of regulated commodities or for a defined time period during
the shipping season.
The activities for the verification of compliance to be implemented should be limited to those under the
arrangement.
When an arrangement is in place, with verification of compliance being undertaken in the exporting
country, the same verification upon import should not be required. However, other procedures
undertaken in the importing country may be:
-     checks of consignment documentation and identity;
-     inspection of consignments where packaging has been compromised and the consignments’
      phytosanitary integrity may have been compromised;
-     inspection of consignments for contaminating pests in containers;
-     inspection of consignments in response to an emerging pest risk that was not known at the time
      of inspection in the exporting country;
-     inspection of consignments where the arrangement allows for a phytosanitary measure after
      inspection in the exporting country (e.g. cold treatment for fruit flies during transport).

ISPM 20-24                                                       International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 1                              ISPM 20



4.    Review of an arrangement
The effectiveness of an arrangement should be reviewed regularly to identify problems and allow their
discussion and resolution in order to improve the arrangement or to determine if it could be downscaled
or terminated. The frequency and timing of reviews should be described in the arrangement. Some
elements of the arrangement may need to be reviewed more frequently than others.
Changes to the existing arrangement may be proposed by the NPPO of the importing country or the
NPPO of the exporting country and require the agreement of both NPPOs before implementation.

5.    Termination of an arrangement
If the reasons for establishing an arrangement are no longer valid (e.g. because of changes in trade
logistics between the two countries) or if the arrangement is no longer needed, the arrangement should
be terminated.
Once an arrangement has been terminated, verification procedures will be conducted in the importing
country.

 ISPM 20                                           Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 2


      This annex was adopted by the Seventeenth Session of the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures in March 2023.
                                      This annex is a prescriptive part of the standard.

ANNEX 2: Use of specific import authorizations
The national plant protection organizations (NPPOs) of importing countries may choose to use specific
import authorizations (SIAs) as referred to in section 4.2.2 of this standard when official consent for
import is necessary; when import would otherwise be prohibited for phytosanitary reasons; or when
phytosanitary import requirements for the particular purpose, articles or situations have not yet been
established. Even when using SIAs as part of their phytosanitary import regulatory system, NPPOs are
still required to make their phytosanitary import requirements available as described in section 5.1.9.2
of this standard and in Article VII.2(b) of the IPPC.
This annex describes situations where the use of SIAs may be required by an NPPO, the information
that should be included on SIAs, and the respective responsibilities of the parties involved. Specific
import authorizations are generally applied on a case-by-case basis and tailored to each specific import
situation. They may be issued for individual consignments or a series of consignments of a particular
origin. Although it is noted that some countries include non-phytosanitary requirements in their SIAs,
this annex addresses only phytosanitary requirements. This annex does not cover information on general
import authorizations, which can be found in section 4.2.2 of this standard, or transit authorization,
which can be found in section 4.3 of this standard.

1.      Types of specific import authorizations
Specific import authorizations may be provided in the form of import permits, licences or other types of
written authorization as determined by the NPPO of the importing country, and may be in either paper
or electronic format.

2.      Elements of specific import authorizations
When SIAs are used, they should be issued by the NPPO of the importing country to importers.

2.1     Information requirements
The following information is the minimum information that should be included in SIAs:
-     name of the issuing NPPO, contact information for verification purposes, and name of the
      importing country;
-     identification code or SIA number;
-     importer’s information (e.g. name and address of importer);
-     date of issuance;
-     description of the consignment covered by the SIA;
-     country of origin and country of export or re-export;
-     intended use of the commodity or commodities that make up the consignment;
-     phytosanitary import requirements (where these have been established); and
-     period of validity.
Other information may also be included in SIAs, such as:
-     quantity of the commodity in the consignment (number of units that make up the consignment, or
      its weight or volume);
-     whether the authorization is for an individual consignment or a series of consignments;
-     means of conveyance;
-     point of entry;
-     name and signature of the authorized issuing officer;
-     official seal, stamp or mark identifying the issuing NPPO;

ISPM 20-26                                                              International Plant Protection Convention
 Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 2                                ISPM 20



-     exporter’s information (e.g. name and address of exporter);
-     location to which the consignment is to be directed (e.g. post-entry quarantine facility, processing
      facility); and
-     treatment provider.

2.2   Language
The NPPOs of importing countries may choose the language or languages in which their SIAs are issued
but are encouraged to also use one of the official languages of FAO, preferably English.

3.    Uses of specific import authorizations
The following are examples of purposes, articles and situations related to import where use of SIAs may
be appropriate:
-     research and scientific purposes;
-     exhibition purposes;
-     educational purposes;
-     religious or cultural purposes (e.g. religious festivals, ancestral customs);
-     articles for which the NPPO of the importing country requires the ability to trace and manage
      over a period of time after entry (e.g. articles subject to post-entry quarantine or processing);
-     emergency or exceptional situations;
-     biological control agents and other beneficial organisms;
-     situations where general import authorizations have not been developed or it is not possible to
      develop them; and
-     articles that are not routinely imported.
The list above is not intended to be exhaustive and countries are not required to use SIAs for the
examples provided.

4.    Responsibilities
4.1   The NPPO of the importing country
The responsibilities of the NPPO of the importing country should include the following elements:
-     publishing (e.g. on the NPPO website) information on the regulated articles and intended uses for
      which an SIA is required;
-     having a process in place for assessing and identifying the information that will be needed for
      SIAs;
-     having a process in place for amending, suspending or revoking SIAs, including a process to
      communicate with relevant parties when this occurs;
-     publishing the process by which an importer can apply for an SIA and the application form that
      the importer needs to complete;
-     stating the language or languages used in SIAs;
-     communicating all requirements to the importer;
-     clearly specifying phytosanitary import requirements in SIAs (where these have been
      established);
-     issuing an SIA without undue delay once the information and assurances required by the NPPO
      have been provided by the importer;
-     providing the NPPOs of exporting countries, on request, with information to verify the
      authenticity of SIAs and provide clarification as needed; and
-     monitoring trade and compliance with SIAs and considering the transfer of SIAs to general import
      authorizations where appropriate.

 ISPM 20                                   Guidelines for a phytosanitary import regulatory system – Annex 2



4.2   Importers
The responsibilities of importers, as determined by the NPPO of the importing country, should include:
-     obtaining an SIA before import in situations where it is required;
-     complying with the requirements of the SIA;
-     if required, providing the SIA to the exporter;

 IPPC
The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is an
international plant health agreement that aims to protect
global plant resources and facilitate safe trade.
The IPPC vision is that all countries have the capacity to
implement harmonized measures to prevent pest introductions
and spread, and minimize the impacts of pests on food
security, trade, economic growth, and the environment.



Organization
◆ There are over 180 IPPC contracting parties.
◆ Each contracting party has a national plant protection

   organization (NPPO) and an Official IPPC contact point.
◆ 10 regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs) have

   been established to coordinate NPPOs in various regions
   of the world.
◆ The IPPC Secretariat liaises with relevant international

   organizations to help build regional and national
