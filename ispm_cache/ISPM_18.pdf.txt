Outline of requirements
This standard provides guidance on irradiation and its application as a phytosanitary measure to comply
with phytosanitary import requirements.
The standard describes the roles and responsibilities of parties involved in the use of irradiation as a
phytosanitary measure. It contains guidance for national plant protection organizations (NPPOs) on
responsibilities for approving treatment facilities, and for monitoring and auditing treatment facilities
and providers.

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this standard is to provide generic requirements for the application of ionizing radiation
as a phytosanitary measure, specifically for those treatments adopted under ISPM 28 (Phytosanitary
treatments for regulated pests).
ISPM 28 was adopted to harmonize effective phytosanitary treatments over a wide range of
circumstances and to enhance the mutual recognition of treatment efficacy by NPPOs, which may

International Plant Protection Convention                                                      ISPM 18-5
 ISPM 18                                      Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure



facilitate safe trade. ISPM 28 provides requirements for submission and evaluation of efficacy data and
other relevant information on phytosanitary treatments. The annexes of ISPM 28 contain specific
irradiation treatments that have been evaluated and adopted by the Commission on Phytosanitary
Measures.
Irradiation is considered to be effective when the phytosanitary treatment dose of ionizing radiation
(hereafter referred to as the “phytosanitary treatment dose”) required by the treatment schedule is
absorbed at the location in the process load that receives the lowest dose of radiation. Therefore, process
control relies on identifying the minimum dose location for a specific loading configuration of a
commodity and routinely delivering to this location a dose of ionizing radiation (a minimum dose) that
is equal to or greater than the required phytosanitary treatment dose. The effectiveness of the treatment
process also includes phytosanitary measures applied to prevent infestation or contamination after
irradiation.

IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Irradiation may be used to prevent the introduction and spread of regulated pests and hence may be
beneficial to biodiversity. The use of irradiation as an alternative to methyl bromide fumigation provides
an additional benefit to the environment by reducing methyl bromide emissions, which deplete the ozone
layer.

REQUIREMENTS

1.    Irradiation objective
The objective of using irradiation as a phytosanitary measure is to achieve, at a specified efficacy, certain
pest responses such as:
-      inability to develop successfully (e.g. non-emergence of adults);
-      inability to reproduce (e.g. sterility);
-      mortality (e.g. mortality of certain vectors of pests);
-      inactivation; or
-      devitalization of plants (e.g. seeds may germinate but seedlings do not grow; or tubers or bulbs
       do not sprout).
Where the required response is the inability of the pest to reproduce, a range of options may be specified.
These may include:
-     complete sterility in one or both sexes;
-     oviposition or hatching without further development; or
-     sterility of the F1 generation.

2.    Irradiation application
Ionizing radiation may be provided by radioactive isotopes (gamma rays from cobalt-60 or caesium-
137), electrons (up to 10 MeV) or X-rays (up to 7.5 MeV) generated from machine sources. The unit of
measurement for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy).
The phytosanitary treatment dose is the minimum dose required to achieve the pest response at the
specified efficacy. The treatment is dependent upon the understanding of dose distribution within the
loading configuration and consistent presentation of the process load to the ionizing radiation. Factors
that may alter the effectiveness of the treatment may include inconsistent loading configurations and
variable levels of oxygen (O2).
To ensure that the phytosanitary treatment dose has been attained throughout the process load, treatment
procedures should ensure that the minimum absorbed dose (Dmin) is equal to or greater than the required

ISPM 18-6                                                         International Plant Protection Convention
 Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure                                  ISPM 18



phytosanitary treatment dose. The intended use of the commodity should be considered. For example,
although appropriate for foods and agricultural products for processing or consumption, irradiation may
not be appropriate for plants for planting, as it may devitalize them, and maximum absorbed doses may
need to be considered as prescribed by food safety authorities.
It is rare that mortality is technically justified as the required response to irradiation. It is therefore
possible for live, non-viable target pests to be found in correctly treated commodities. This does not
imply a failure of the treatment. It does mean, however, that it is essential for the treatment to be applied
correctly to ensure that any target pests that are still alive are unable to complete development or
otherwise reproduce. In addition, it is preferable that such pests are unable to escape into the
environment unless they can be distinguished from non-irradiated pests.
Irradiation may be applied:
-      as an integral part of packing operations;
-      to bulk unpackaged commodities; or
-      to packaged commodities.
Irradiation may take place in the country of origin. When it is operationally feasible to prevent the escape
of any pests during transport of the untreated commodity, treatment may alternatively be conducted at:
-      the point of entry;
-      a designated location in a third country; or
-      a designated location within the country of final destination.
Treated commodities should be certified and released only after dosimetry measurements show that no
absorbed doses were less than the required phytosanitary treatment dose and therefore that the dose
requirement has been met throughout the process load.
Depending on the pest risk to be managed, the tolerance of the commodity to treatment, and the
availability of other pest risk management options, irradiation may be used either as a single
phytosanitary measure or combined with other measures as part of a systems approach (see ISPM 14
(The use of integrated measures in a systems approach for pest risk management)).

3.     Dosimetry
Irradiation does not deliver a uniform dose throughout a process load but a continuum of doses. The
dose range may increase as the size or density of the treated material increases. Therefore, it is important
that an accurate measurement of the absorbed dose in a process load can be readily determined to ensure
that the required phytosanitary treatment dose has been reached throughout the load.
Dosimetry provides assurance that Dmin is equal to or greater than the required phytosanitary treatment
dose and therefore that the dose requirement has been met throughout the process load. Properly
designed systems for treatment delivery and protection against infestation and contamination, together
with continual checking and regular monitoring of those systems, provide assurance that treatments are
properly conducted. Dosimetry is highly specialized; NPPOs unfamiliar with irradiation should
therefore collaborate with technical experts from their national nuclear agencies when approving
facilities to be used for irradiating commodities for phytosanitary purposes.

3.1    Dosimetry systems
A dosimetry system consists of dosimeters, instruments that read dosimeters, and associated procedures
and standards. A dosimeter is a device with a reproducible response to irradiation that can be used to
measure the absorbed dose. The dosimeter responds to the radiation and the response is measured by
instruments to calculate the amount of ionizing radiation that the process load has absorbed (expressed
as absorbed dose).



International Plant Protection Convention                                                         ISPM 18-7
 ISPM 18                                      Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure



The selection and use of specific dosimetry systems should be appropriate for both the dose range and
the type of radiation. It should take into account the influence of factors such as dose rates, the level of
uncertainty deemed to be acceptable and the required spatial resolution. Examples of dosimetry systems
that can be used for gamma ray, electron beam and X-ray facilities can be found in ISO/ASTM
51261:2013.

3.2   Dose mapping
Dose mapping is performed by placing dosimeters throughout the process load, irradiating the process
load and reading the dosimeter values. Further information on the practices used for electron beams and
X-rays are described in ISO 14470:2011 and ISO/ASTM 51261:2013.
The objectives of dose mapping are:
-     to determine the dose distribution throughout the process load and in particular where Dmin and
      Dmax are found;
-     to demonstrate that the required phytosanitary treatment dose can be attained for the process load
      (i.e. Dmin can be equal to or greater than the required phytosanitary treatment dose);
-     to establish the process parameters that will lead to doses within the required range;
-     to assess the variability of the particular process; and
-     to establish how routine dose measurements will be made.
The dose distribution in a process load is specific to the irradiator, the path and speed that the commodity
takes through the irradiator, the load configuration and the characteristics of the commodity. If any of
these factors change, dose mapping should be repeated, as such changes affect dose distribution.

3.3   Routine dosimetry
Accurate measurements of absorbed dose in a process load are critical for determining the effectiveness
of the treatment. They are part of the quality control of the treatment and of the validation process. The
required number, location and frequency of these measurements should be prescribed based on the
specific equipment, processes, commodities, relevant standards and phytosanitary requirements.
When the position of Dmin or Dmax is inside the process load and it is not practical to place dosimeters
there routinely, a dosimeter may be placed in a reference location on the surface of the process load or
on the irradiation container in a location that is readily accessible and easily reproducible for the operator
(see Appendix 1). For a given loading configuration, a given path through the irradiator or given
machine settings, the relationship between the dose measured at the reference location (Dref) and Dmin
and Dmax is arithmetic and constant. The coefficient representing this relationship should be established
by dose mapping and may then be used to calculate Dmin and Dmax from Dref during routine dosimetry.

4.    Validation
Validation encompasses a series of checks designed to verify that a treatment facility meets its
installation requirements (installation qualification), operates to its design specification (operational
qualification) and will consistently deliver the required dose to a given process load within
predetermined tolerances (performance qualification).
Installation qualification and operational qualification validate the irradiator and may be performed by
the treatment provider with the technology suppliers. National plant protection organizations are
typically not involved with installation- or operational-qualification activities, but the treatment provider
should inform the NPPO if major changes have been made to the facility that would require dose
mapping to be repeated (e.g. replenishment of gamma sources or major changes to conveyor-belt
systems or speeds).
The way in which the commodity is loaded and irradiated is based on the results of the performance
qualification. Therefore, the NPPO should review the performance-qualification activities that are


ISPM 18-8                                                         International Plant Protection Convention
 Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure                                     ISPM 18



undertaken with the actual commodity and loading configuration (e.g. full pallet or half pallet). The
objective of performance qualification is to demonstrate that the equipment, as installed and properly
operated, consistently performs as expected and that the treatment schedule can be met. Dose mapping
of the actual process load to define the loading configuration is a key activity to ensure that the required
phytosanitary treatment dose is achieved.

5.     Adequate systems for treatment facilities
Confidence in the adequacy of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure is primarily based on assurance
that the treatment schedule is effective against the target pests under specific conditions and the
treatment has been properly applied. Systems for treatment delivery in the facilities should be designed,
used and monitored to ensure that treatments are properly conducted.
The NPPO of the country in which the treatment facility is located is responsible for ensuring that the
facility system requirements are met.

5.1    Approval of treatment facilities and authorization of treatment providers
Treatment facilities should be approved by the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located
before phytosanitary treatments are applied there, with such approval thereby providing authorization
to the treatment provider responsible for the facility to conduct treatments according to agreed
procedures. This approval should be subsequent to authorization from competent authorities for safety
(e.g. radiation safety authority, nuclear regulatory authority) where appropriate and be based on a set of
criteria that include both criteria common to all irradiation facilities and those that are specific to the site
and commodity (see Annex 1). Guidance on authorizing entities to perform phytosanitary actions can
be found in ISPM 45 (Requirements for national plant protection organizations if authorizing entities
to perform phytosanitary actions).
Evaluation of irradiation facilities for re-approval should be carried out by the NPPO on a regular basis
at appropriate intervals.

5.2    Prevention of infestation and contamination after treatment
The consignment owner is responsible for prevention of infestation and contamination after irradiation
and may cooperate with the treatment provider on how to achieve this. At the treatment facility, the
necessary measures should be implemented to prevent possible infestation or contamination of the
commodity after treatment. The following measures may be required:
-     keeping the commodity in a pest free enclosure under conditions that protect it from infestation
      and contamination;
-     packing the commodity immediately after irradiation;
-     segregating and identifying irradiated commodities; and
-     dispatching the commodity as soon as possible after irradiation.
The use of pest-proof packaging before irradiation may help to prevent possible infestation or
contamination after irradiation. It may also prevent the accidental escape of the target pests before
treatment if irradiation is applied at the destination.

5.3    Labelling
The treatment provider is responsible for labelling commodities with treatment lot numbers or other
identifying features allowing trace-back for non-compliant consignments. The labels should be easily
identifiable and placed in visible locations.

5.4    Monitoring and auditing
The NPPO of the country in which the irradiation is conducted should monitor and audit treatment
facilities and providers in accordance with ISPM 47 (Audit in the phytosanitary context). The NPPO
should maintain an audit schedule and ensure that such audits are conducted by appropriately trained

International Plant Protection Convention                                                            ISPM 18-9
 ISPM 18                                    Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure



personnel. Continuous supervision of irradiation by the NPPO should not be necessary, provided
treatment procedures are properly designed by the treatment provider and can be verified to ensure a
high degree of system integrity for the facility, process and commodity in question. The monitoring and
auditing should be sufficient to detect and correct deficiencies promptly.
Treatment providers should meet monitoring and auditing requirements set by the NPPO. These
requirements may include:
-     access for the NPPO to conduct audits, including unannounced visits;
-     a system to maintain and archive treatment records and provide the NPPO with access to these;
      and
-     corrective action to be taken in the event of nonconformity.
The NPPO of the importing country may establish approval and audit procedures with the NPPO of the
exporting country to verify conformity with requirements.

6.    Documentation
The NPPO of the country in which the irradiation is conducted is responsible for ensuring that treatment
providers document all operational procedures and keep appropriate records, such as raw data on
dosimetry readings recorded during treatments. Accurate record-keeping is essential to enable auditing
and trace-back.

6.1   Documentation of procedures
Procedures should be documented by treatment providers to ensure that commodities are consistently
treated as required. Process controls and operational parameters should be established to provide the
details necessary for the specific approval of a treatment facility. Calibration and quality control
procedures should be documented by the treatment provider. The documented procedures should include
the following:
-      commodity-handling procedures before, during and after irradiation;
-      orientation and loading configuration of the commodity during irradiation;
-      critical process parameters and the means for measuring and recording them;
-      dosimetry and calibration of the dosimetry system;
-      contingency plans and corrective actions to be taken in the event of treatment failure or problems
       with critical treatment processes;
-      procedures for handling rejected lots;
-      labelling, record-keeping and documentation requirements; and
-      training of personnel.

6.2   Record-keeping
The treatment provider should keep appropriate records for each treatment application. These records
should be made available to the NPPO of the country in which the treatment facility is located for
auditing and verification purposes or when a trace-back is necessary.
Appropriate treatment records for irradiation as a phytosanitary measure should be retained by the
treatment provider for at least one year to enable the trace-back of treated lots. Information that may be
required to be recorded includes:
-     identification of facility and responsible parties;
-     commodity treated;
-     target regulated pest;
-     treatment objective (i.e. required response);
-     owner, packer, grower and place of production of the commodity;

 Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure                                  ISPM 18



-      lot size and volume, including number of articles or packages;
-      identifying markings or characteristics;
-      orientation and loading configuration of the commodity during irradiation;
-      absorbed doses (required doses and measured doses), dosimetry calibration and dose mapping
       records;
-      date of treatment; and
-      any observed deviation from the treatment schedule and, where appropriate, subsequent actions
       taken.

6.3    Documentation by the NPPO
All NPPO procedures should be appropriately documented. Records, including those of monitoring
inspections made and phytosanitary certificates issued, should be maintained for at least one year. In
cases of non-compliance or new or unexpected phytosanitary situations, documentation should be made
available upon request as described in ISPM 13 (Guidelines for the notification of non-compliance and
emergency action).

7.     Inspection
Inspection should be carried out by the NPPO of the exporting country and inspection at import may be
carried out by the NPPO of the importing country to determine compliance with phytosanitary import
requirements.
Live target pests may be found during inspection after irradiation, but this should not result in the refusal
to issue a phytosanitary certificate. Where mortality is not the required response, it is likely that live
target pests may persist in the treated consignment; in such cases, phytosanitary certification should be
based on confirmation from the validation programme that the required minimum dose is administered
and the required response is achieved for the specific treatment conditions concerned (see section 2).

8.     Responsibilities
The NPPO of the country in which the irradiation is conducted is responsible for the evaluation, approval
and auditing of the application of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure.
To the extent necessary, the NPPO should cooperate with other national regulatory agencies concerned
with the development, approval and safety of irradiation, including the training and certification of
personnel conducting the treatment and the approval of treatment facilities. The respective
responsibilities of the NPPO and the other regulatory agencies should be identified to avoid requirements
that are overlapping, conflicting, inconsistent or unjustified.
The treatment provider is responsible for implementing the treatment in accordance with the NPPO
requirements, for documenting procedures, for keeping the treatment records, and for making these
documents and records available for auditing and verification purposes.

 ISPM 18                            Requirements for the use of irradiation as a phytosanitary measure – Appendix 1


                This appendix is for reference purposes only and is not a prescriptive part of the standard.

APPENDIX 1: Example of a dosimeter in a reference location
In Figure 1, the coefficients (Rmin and Rmax) representing the relationship between the minimum (Dmin)
and maximum (Dmax) absorbed doses and the absorbed dose in the reference location (Dref) have been
calculated as 0.8 and 1.4, respectively. The calculations are as follows:
      Measured values:
      Dmax = 4.2 kGy
      Dmin = 2.4 kGy
      Dref = 3.0 kGy

      Therefore:
      Rmin = Dmin/Dref = 2.4 kGy/3.0 kGy = 0.8
      Rmax = Dmax/Dref = 4.2 kGy/3.0 kGy = 1.4


Thus, if the target dose range is Dmin = 2.0 kGy and Dmax = 5.0 kGy, one can estimate the routine values
for Dref to be:
       Dref = Dmin/Rmin = 2.0 kGy/0.8 = 2.5 kGy at a minimum
       Dref = Dmax/Rmax = 5.0 kGy/1.4 = 3.57 kGy at a maximum.
For further examples, please refer to IAEA (2015).
